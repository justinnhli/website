Title: Social Search

For one of my classes I recently had to suggest a new search engine
feature then make a pitch about it. That was what started the [cree.pr
project](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2009/04/stranger-appeal.html).
Most of the pitches weren't that interesting (no offense to anyone in
the class reading this), but after hearing a whole bunch of them I had a
revelation: Social search is a crappy idea.

Here by social search I mean something where the results shown are
somehow influenced by what previous users have done. Now, it's not the
case that social search is useless. There are entire communities built
upon finding out what other people have done, and using the "wisdom of
the crowd" to just take the cream of the cream.

But aggregating social information to make search results better is a
crappy suggestion, because it's one of the defaults things you can do to
improve search. It is the same thing as saying in a science experiement
that "more data would have made the results more accurate". Well, duh.
Similar suggestions would be to use more CPUs or build more datahubs.

So people, please actually think of something partially innovative next
time.
