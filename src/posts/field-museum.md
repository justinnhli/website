Title: Field Museum

Continuing my tradition of skipping campus during finals week, I want to
the Field Museum today. It's the last free admissions day of the year,
and it was fun. As with the Science and Industry Museum, some of the
exhibits looked kinda old; however, since it's a museum of natural
history, that's more acceptable.

I have pictures on Picasa:
