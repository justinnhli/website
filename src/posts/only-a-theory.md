I just finished Ken Miller's Only a Theory: Evolution and the Battle for
America's Soul. Miller is the author of one of the most widely used high
school biology text book, and the lead expert witness for the
[Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School
District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District)
case. The book, however, was not as much focused on the trial as on the
ideas behind intelligence design (ID) and evolution, and some comments
by Miller on the intelligent design movement.

Being rather familiar with the arguments of ID, I found the first half
of the book a little dull. However, I do think Miller does a good job of
taking ID arguments seriously, and analyze those ideas from the
scientific perspective. Having heard him lecture at Northwestern's
Darwin celebration last year, his examples are not new to me either. But
in a book, where he can afford to give longer descriptions of the
history of life on Earth, I found myself draw into the subject. For a
short moment I wondered what it would be like to see Earth 1 million,
100 million years ago. And then I realized that, although there might
not have been skyscrapers or monkeys or ants, there was still rain, and
volcanoes, and oceans. And the idea that science can prove all these
things did exist so long ago is rather amazing.

Personally, the more interesting part of the book was where Miller
explained why he thought ID has become what it is, and what we (as
scientists) can do about it. Miller suggests that the ultimate
motivation is philosophical and psychological. Quoting Max Ehrmann's
poem *Desiderata*, he wrote,  

> "No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should" assures us that,
> however chaotic and disorderly the events of our lives may seem at the
> moment, we should take heart, for we were meant to be. And, in the
> eyes of many, that's exactly the problem with evolution - it says that
> we *weren't* meant to be and that the way of things are unfolding

My instinctive response is that, is it such a horrible thing for the
universe to exist without purpose? Must your sense of direction in life
be derived from some external source, and couldn't you create a
direction yourself? This philosophical (in fact, existentialist)
argument also applies to the claim that evolution "doesn't put a moral
demand" on us, as ex-senator Rick Santorum suggested. But this has
nothing to do with evolution.

Miller's reply to the worry is different. He brought up the idea of
convergence - that evolution will keep on returning to good ideas. In
particular, even if humans as a species might not have evolved, it is
almost certain that the niche of an intelligent species capable of
changing their environment would be filled. That is, despite the process
of evolution being probabilistic, we - as intelligent beings - are in
fact guaranteed. This is, the certainty that evolution would have led to
something like us, would help quell the worries.

I want to voice another idea though. This quote comes from the video
game Max Payne 2, and is more about predestination. Applied to evolution
though, it would mean that we are indeed very special:  

> There are no choices. Nothing but a straight line. The illusion comes
> afterwards, when you ask 'Why me?' and 'What if?' When you look back,

The last idea I found intriguing in Miller's book was him mention Allan
Bloom's book, The Closing of the American Mind (which I [wrote about
briefly](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2009/05/thoughts-on-being-student.html)).
Miller quoted Bloom writing:  

> Openness used to be the virtue that permitted us to seek the good by
> using reason. It now means accepting everything and denying reason's
> power. The unrestrained and thoughtless pursuit of openness [...] has
> rendered openness meaningless. [...] The danger [students] have been
> taught to fear is not error but intolerance. [...] The point is not to
> correct the mistakes and really be right, rather it is not to think
> you are right at all.
> </p>

Miller compares this to the calls for "balance" and "openness" to get ID
in public school curriculum. Although that's not the declared goal of
the ID movement, "once the supernatural becomes a valid element in
scientific inquiry, science will cease to be an empirical search for the
truth of the natural world. Like faith itself, "theistic science" will
be a subjective window on the world that reflects the innermost
convictions of its adherents and not of the outer reality of nature."

This whole affair of injecting supernatural causes into science reminds
me of Ellsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead: "Set up standards of
achievement open to all, to the least, to the most ineptâ€”and you stop
the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive
to improvement, to excellence, to perfection."

Without having clear boundaries of what science accepts, science itself
suffers. People no longer need to discover the cause and cure of AIDS,
when a simple "it's divine punishment" will suffice. Our understanding
of the world grinds to a halt, as does our technological advancement -
which depends on the rigorous quest for cause and effect. The "Designer"
did not create the iPod, nor the internet, nor any of modern technology.
All of it is done by men, relying and exploiting our *scientific*
knowledge of the world. Without science, none of that would be possible.

And that is why I truly fear what the ID movement can do to the world.
