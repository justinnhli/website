I first came across
[this](http://www.titane.ca/concordia/dfar251/igod/main.html) from a
photo on Facebook. Obviously, God is not to be mocked, but still...

Me: Did you create the universe?  
God: No I didn't create the universe. What's it like?

Me: God is Christian?  
God: I have a lot of Faith in Him, but I never heard He was Christian.

:D

"Note: iGod is meant to be used for fun. A sense of humour [British!] is
recommended."
