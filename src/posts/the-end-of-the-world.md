For people who haven't seen it, this flash animation is highly
enjoyable:

[The End of the World](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/end)

I sometimes randomly go into "Hokay, here's the earth..." or "but I'm le
tired," and now you know where I got that from.

One thing I noticed several weeks ago while watching it is that, near
the when when California "breaks away from the US to go hang with
Hawaii... Alaska can come too," there are actually <span
style="font-style:italic;">two</span> Alaskas and Hawaiis. The map which
California breaks from already includes those two states, in the left
bottom corner. I wonder if the animator ever noticed that.
