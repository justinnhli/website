I [just tweeted](http://twitter.com/justinnhli/statuses/17309431598) a
very *interesting* two truths and a lie:

-   P=NP
-   All even numbers greater than 2 are sums of primes
-   The logical conjunction of the above two

I'll leave the solution to the reader. It occurred to me while lying in
bed, however, that it should be possible to make a list such that *any
of the three* can be the lie. After a little thought and some trial and
error, the following fits the bill:

-   One of the following two statements is false
-   One of the other two statements is false
-   One of the previous two statements is false

Simple, but it works. Neat.

This reminds me of [the riddle in Inside
Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454848/quotes?qt0501964):

> Which weighs more: all the trains that pass through Grand Central
> Station [in NYC] in a year - or the trees cut down to print all U.S.
> currency in circulation? Here's a hint: It's a trick question.

Once again, I leave the solution as an exercise to the reader... or you
can watch the movie.

EDIT: here are a few more humorous Two Truths and A Lie's I came up
with:

-   Water is wet
-   Fire is hot
-   The cake

"well, *obviously*, [the cake is a
lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29#Plot)."

-   You think this one is true
-   You think the last one is probably the lie
-   You're not sure anymore

What?

-   Either you won't answer, or you'll answer correctly
-   Either you won't answer, or you'll answer incorrectly
-   You will answer

Interestingly, it's possible to correctly answer this last one. You can
figure out how.
