Slug: how-my-classes-are-going

-   Independent study's gone its own way
-   Algorithms homework is in an orderly array
-   Complexity's complicated
-   Design Porfolio has yet to be decorated
-   ASG websites' keeping me in the dark
-   NUOC's a walk in the park
-   Chimps are going ape, and giraffes remain above it all
-   Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
-   The buffalos have got a beef about this season's grass
-   Warthogs have been thwarted in attempts to save their gas

This is the morning report... :D
