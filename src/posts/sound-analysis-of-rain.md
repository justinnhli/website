It's raining outside, and I just walked past a tree with a lot of dead
leaves on it. It makes the rain seem a lot heavier than it is, because
of all the tip-tap-py noise it generates.

I wonder if it's possibly to work out in detail what the tree is just by
recording the noise with microphones located all around the tree.
