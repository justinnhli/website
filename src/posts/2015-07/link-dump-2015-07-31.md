* [A good article](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/stop-acting-so-surprised-how-microaggressions-enforce-stereotypes-in-tech) describing how people in tech (and more generally, in STEM) commit micro-aggressions in our daily language. I'm still working on some of these - for example, I still use a fairly demanding "why didn't you use a function here?" instead of something softer like "can you explain your thought process for this part?"

* Sometimes your "dream job" [turns out to not be as exciting](http://www.xojane.com/fashion/why-i-quit-my-job-as-a-modeling-agent) as you think it is...

* ... and sometimes the process of getting to your dream job is [just not worth it](https://medium.com/the-hodgepodge-institute/why-i-chose-to-give-up-on-academia-df6855611d0d).

* That said, if you are going to be a grad student at Michigan, the [new grad student dorms](http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/07/heres_your_first_chance_to_see.html) seem like a good place to live. I particularly like that they're mixing students of different disciplines.

* Going further down the education hierarchy, if college is not for you, [consider an apprenticeship instead](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/business/economy/a-new-look-at-apprenticeships-as-a-path-to-the-middle-class.html). I'm fairly sure that apprenticing under a skilled laborer is a much better return on investment than attending particular colleges and pursuing particular college careers.

* There are people who [fly around the world for a living](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/ben-schlappig-airlines-fly-free-20150720). As in, they don't have an apartment, and live on planes and in airports. I do like how the article turns introspective at the end.

* It turns out you don't need to know the language to win Scrabble in that language. You just need to [memorize the dictionary](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/21/new-french-scrabble-champion-nigel-richards-doesnt-speak-french).

* Dan Savage [points out the hypocrisy](https://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/07/20/22573934/gawker-outs-one-cheater-and-the-internet-condemns-gawkerhackers-expose-37-million-cheaters-and-the-internet-condemns-cheaters) of blasting the media for outing one cheater, but blasting the cheaters when thousand of them are exposed by hackers in the Ashley Madison expose. I wonder if there's a psychological term for this; it's not scale insensitivity (in which case people won't care), it's almost scale inversion.

* North Koreans use IP addresses (ie. [http://74.125.224.72/]()) instead of domain names (ie. [https://www.google.com/]()), because [the most of the population don't know how to type](http://www.northkoreatech.org/2015/07/06/a-peek-inside-north-koreas-intranet/).

* [Moscow is a state of mind]. How Moscow.

* An autistic female tech employee writes about how modern dialog on gender bias in tech fails to meet the needs of the women who, well, [never had trouble fitting into tech](https://medium.com/@maradydd/okay-feminism-its-time-we-had-a-talk-about-empathy-bd6321c66b37). That the author spent more time with computers in her youth is a privilege, but not one that directly relates to gender biases.

* A professor at Johns Hopkins [wants graduate science degrees to include more philosophy](http://magazine.jhsph.edu/2015/summer/forum/rethinking-put-the-ph-back-in-phd/index.html) - epistemology, ethics, etc.

* I spend a lot of time worrying about how to teach computer science to supplement how students think outside of the classroom. [This professor wonders the same thing about philosophy](http://thepointmag.com/2015/examined-life/complications-of-philosophy).

* [A short portrait of Terry Tao](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html) (the mathematician).

* [Empathy is a choice](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/opinion/sunday/empathy-is-actually-a-choice.html), and "people with a higher sense of power exhibit less empathy because they have less incentive to interact with others." I wonder if that also means introverts have less empathy than extroverts.
