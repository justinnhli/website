Fewer links this time due to the holidays...

* [Programming is magic](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/18/programming-is-magic/): they both involve using seemingly incomprehensible esoteric languages to perform feats that the uninitiated do not understand and did not think was possible.

* [Gradual typing](http://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/) is a middle ground between strongly- and weakly-typed languages. As someone with a significant interest in programming languages, this is actually really cool. The only thing I don't like about this idea is not mentioning type inference - which, I guess, also shows my artificial intelligence bias.

* A comment from Scott Aaronson about [the suffering of (male) nerds](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2091#comment-326664) has been making the rounds around the internet. A good argument against is how [female nerds are shamed for wanting to have sex](http://www.newstatesman.com/laurie-penny/on-nerd-entitlement-rebel-alliance-empire)... and *still* suffer from institutional discrimination besides. Also, I have issues with the dick measuring contest that is comparing whether one outgroup is more oppressed than another.

* Also on gender: gender still matters [precisely because you're asking why scientists mentioned they're female](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/mit-scientists-on-women-in-stem/), and you don't do the same when they mention they're male. Among the less egregious comments.

* Over the last six months I've thought a lot about the traits that would make me advise someone to go to grad school, and what students can do to prepare for it. Apparently [being accepted to grad school used to be easier](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/12/undergraduate-research.html), and didn't (de facto) require doing research as an undergraduate. I myself did two semesters of research, and taught a while bunch besides... not that most universities care that much about your teaching experience.

* Too often we [lack the resolve to act](http://thefrailestthing.com/2014/12/31/what-do-we-want-really/) to get what we really want. I suspect, though, that someone who regularly has the resolve to do so would be seen as monstrous by most people - ie. that we are unwilling to pay the cost of being willing to pay the cost.

* Why does technology [only make us feel busier](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-21/the-intellectual-situation/too-fast-too-furious/), when it's supposed to save us time?
