I have written about Pascal's Wager
[before](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2008/10/pascals-wager.html), but
I never finished that post. A few days ago I came across a video, which
finally closed the case on that argument for me.

The inspiration is [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpJ7yUPwdU),
which I found on Reddit. Most of the video is junk and doesn't hold up
to my standards of reason. Something at the end caught my attention
though, and I came up with the following argument.

Recall that the problem with Pascal's wager is that, unlike most
arguments about God, it's a completely rational. It frames the problem
in turns of expected utilities, which is the standard practice in
decision theory. The following payoff matrix summarizes the wager:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>
</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">
God Exists

</th>
<th>
God Doesn't Exist

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">
Believe in God

</th>
<td style="text-align:center;">
+Infinity

</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
0

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">
Don't Believe in God

</th>
<td style="text-align:center;">
-Infinity

</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
0

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Richard Dawkin's argument, that believing in God has a cost while
living, doesn't hold up, as any cost incurred while alive is only
finite, and does not offset the infinite payoff of being in heaven.

Pascal's wager is that simple. The video over-complicates and sets up
several straw men (eg. Pascal not knowing what God is but then
contradicting himself) and ad hominem attacks (eg. Pascal's bias towards
Christianity). While the claim that Pascal ignores other gods is true,
his wager still works - as long as gods reward belief, the expected
utility is still to believe in god(s). The existence of non-god systems
(frog's dream, video game, etc), doesn't matter, as they don't offer any
utility. The gem of the video is in a 3 second frame: for every
unknowable idea that rewards a particular behavior, another unknowable
idea will punish that very same behavior.

Here's my new argument. Pascal's wager depends on supposing a Christian
god, with the payoff matrix above. Since, however, the existence of the
Christian god is unknown, it is equally valid to posit a different god
(let's call Him AntiPascal), with different payoffs. In particular,
let's imagine a god that will send people to heaven only if they *don't*
believe in any god, and will send people to hell if they *do*. What does
the payoff matrix look like?

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>
</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">
God Exists

</th>
<th>
God Doesn't Exist

</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">
Believe in God(s)

</th>
<td style="text-align:center;">
-Infinity

</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
0

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;">
Don't Believe in God(s)

</th>
<td style="text-align:center;">
+Infinity

</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
0

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
That's right - everything looks almost exactly the same, except the
signs on those infinities switched. By this payoff matrix, people should
not believe in gods at all.

So which payoff matrix is right? We don't know. To properly calculate
the expected utility of believing in god(s), we need to know the
probability of each payoff matrix itself - that is, the probability that
the Christian god is real (and has the payoff matrix specified), and the
probability that the AntiPascal god exists. Both of these probabilities,
it turns out, is unknowable - and therefore the expected utility of
believing or not believe in god cannot be compared.

Given the odds, Pascal's wager is not one you want to bet on - there's
simply no telling whether you win or lose. While this is no argument
against the belief in god, it is no longer the purely rational argument
for it either.

The funny thing is, although this argument is new to me, the reasoning
behind it is not. As Richard Dawkins himself has said several times,
most theists are in fact atheists to all other religions. Real atheists
just go one further.
