I don't mean to always pick on Google (yeah, pick on someone your own
size...), but I love it and use it so much that any small problem
becomes really annoying.

Since I've installed the Better Gmail 2 Firefox extension, I've become
accustomed to using the keyboard to read my emails. Most keys also work
without the extension, but I love my 'l' shortcut to label
conversations. Anyway (see how much I love Gmail?), the bug I'm talking
about is for the starring key, or 's'. Every key that applies to emails
work the same way, except for this one. If you try to remove the current
label ('y'), it works on all the conversations you've selected. If you
try to delete an email ('\#') or mark it as spam ('!'), it works on the
conversations you've selected. Starring, however, works on the
conversation <span style="font-style:italic;">the pointer is pointing
to</span>. That is, you cannot star multiple emails at the same time;
you have to star, move down ('j'), star, move down, and repeat.

Again, I wish Google would just [follow the
rules](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/12/bugger-blog-3.html),
instead of having different functions operate differently.
