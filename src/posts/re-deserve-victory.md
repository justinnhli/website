[A while
back](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2008/01/deserve-victory.html) I
wrote about this motto I have, "Deserve Victory". I recently read
another one of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series (Faith of the
Fallen - "available"
[here](http://www.wattpad.com/96772-Terry-Goodkind-Faith-of-the-Fallen)),
although it was out of order of the series. It did make me think of
broader meanings for the phrase though, and I would like to share that
in this post. They roughly separate into the stages of committing to an
act, acting, and reflecting after the act.

1.  "Your life is yours alone. Rise up and live it."

> As I said before, "deserve victory" doesn't mean "I deserve victory".
> It means "work to deserve victory" - that victory does not come flying
> into your arms. Victory can be taken as whatever is desired:
> happiness, fame, fortune, a good job, etc. Especially for happiness,
> if you are not happy now, sitting on your ass and waiting will not
> change that fact. Act to change the circumstance, and find that
> happiness. You are responsible for your victory, and it's time to make
> yourself deserve it.

> Another way to look at it is as a challenge: you think you deserve
> victory, so prove it. Show the world why you deserve it, and then
> you'll get it.

1.  Do not accept defeat.

1.  Do not regret.
