Title: Blogger Trial

I kind of like Blogger. It seems simpler to use than LiveJournal, and
since Google owns it, I'll be constantly logged on anyway. I want to
blog more, with smaller posts more often. One thing I should do is try
and sync LiveJournal with this thing, so posts automatically appear
there. Shouldn't be that hard.

The hardest part of blogging for me is that I already keep a personal
journal; it's tough to find extra stuff to write. Let's look at this as
an exercise in creativity and observation.

Not to mention note taking.
