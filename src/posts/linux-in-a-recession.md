I don't have much time this week, so this will be a short post. I also
happen to have an economics midterm coming up, so why not write about
that?

I was thinking about Linux adoption and how the operating system market
fits into the nice supply and demand diagram. Linux, as a free (as in
beer) alternative, should in theory rapidly take over the market. Of
course, that is not the case, with Microsoft still having a strong hold
with Windows.

Then I learned about inferior goods. For normal goods, when people have
more spending power (ie. more income), people buy more. For inferior
goods though, people buy more when they have *less* income. The word
"inferior" refers not to the quality of the product, but to when people
are willing to pay for them.

Which makes me wonder - would Linux be considered an inferior good? At
some point of income loss, people must balance the familiarity of
Windows with the lost cost of Linux. Below that income, people will buy
(er, download) Linux; above that income, people will buy Windows. From
this reasoning, it seems that a recession - like the one we're going
through - can only *help* spread Linux to more people.

I wonder where I can find the Linux adoption data to match up with
economy recessions.
