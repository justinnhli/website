This
[article](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3720506) was
in my RSS feed a few days ago, and while it talks about free software
users (of which I definitely am one; the only non-free software on my
computer right now is Acrobat Reader, Java), it also reminded me of the
[conversation](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/11/computer-science-problem-solving.html)
about whether being a computer scientist changes the way I think.

Of the 9 characteristics, I found the following 4 to be the most true:

-   Free software users expect to work the way they choose
-   Free software users want control of their own systems
-   Free software users explore
-   Free software users expect to help themselves

I wonder, however, if it is the usage of free software which creates
these characteristics in people, or if they were here to begin with.

The first two points go together; to work the way we choose we need to
have control of the system. This I find might be a consequence of using
free software. Before I started using Linux, I was not as particular
about the system I'm using. I did
[write](http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/konspose-notes)
[Konfabulator](http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/text-calendar)
[widgets](http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/notes) to make life easier,
but that was the only major modification I made to the system. Compared
to how I make my own Flubox themes and [heavily mod
Firefox](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/12/pimpin-firefox.html),
those widgets were only minor configurations. I now get easily annoyed
when I have to run the command line to get the uptime of my laptop in
Windows (I use conky for Linux). Picky.

For the third point, that free software people like to explore, I think
that might be a personality trait before using free software. The very
fact that they are users indicate that they are looking for
alternatives, since no software is bundled with Windows or Macs. I've
always had broad interests, and have been (and tried to be more so
lately) a curious child. I think that counts as exploring.

Finally, that free software users expect to help themselves... I'm not
sure. Part of helping themselves is trying new things and exploring,
which is covered by the third point. Another part of it, however, might
be that it is so much easier (more central, if not more common) to find
help for open source software. I don't know which one caused which.

I do think all of these are good traits though.
