This week has been pretty tough for me, for at least the start of the
week. All my classes have work due on either Monday, Tuesday, or
Wednesday, so I usually have nothing to do Wednesday evenings. That
said, I've kept myself busy:

-   Gave a review session for the EA midterm
-   Wrote sections of a progress report for my design project
-   Wrote a paper on foundationalism - leading me to stay up till 6 am
    on Wednesday
-   Watched clips of early computer animation, in an showing titled
    "Imaging by Numbers"
-   Planned out some details of spring break
-   Went climbing - twice, one on Friday and once today
-   Watched Rocket Science
