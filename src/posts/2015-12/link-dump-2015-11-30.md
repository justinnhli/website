* Google released Tensor Flow, their AI engine, [suggesting that the future of AI is in data, not in code](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-open-sourcing-tensorflow-shows-ais-future-is-data-not-code/), the argument being that they are giving the code away. I don't disagree with them on this particular aspect, but I do want to point out that they are specifically talking about the kind of AI that *extracts knowledge*, not the kind of AI that *acts*.

* Every so often I think about what could happen that would ruin my life the most. Blindness always ranks pretty high, but I think a loss of the ability to use language, [including the ability to talk to myself](http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/what-happens-when-you-cant-talk-to-yourself), is much scarier.

* [VATSIM is a multi-player air traffic simulation](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/11/18/vatsim/). People play both pilots and ATC, and they do everything from routine trans-Atlantic flights to engine-out emergency landings. If I had any interest in aviation, I would find this even more interesting than I already do.

* [Jetpacks. Next to a 787.](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-11/05/jetman-fly-plane-emirates-dubai)

* This article [about software "engineers"](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/) has gotten a lot of press, but I actually find its thesis a little confused. The author seems to be arguing that we should stop using the "software engineer" *label*, while simultaneously saying that software failures can lead to increasingly large disasters - a problem that removing a label won't fix. I have more thoughts on this, that I might put in a longer blog post at a later date.

* Race preferential admission [may be doing more harm than good](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2015/08/a-dubious-expediency-how-race-preferential-admissions-policies-on-campus-hurt-minority-students). The argument is that students face a gap in ability between them and their peers, and may end up demoralized. Worse, this happens throughout the "pecking order" of universities, leading to a global (instad of local) phenomenon. The article is actually a rather depressing read.

* [Oxy professor writes about the Oxy student protests](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/the-new-wave-of-campus-pr_b_8635580.html). Favorite except: "My only real concern is whether students - at Oxy and elsewhere - can "seal the deal." Students today are so skeptical of people in power (including college administrators) that they sometimes can't take "yes" for an answer."

* When celebrating the achievements of someone, should we [take into account their negatives](http://dailynous.com/2015/11/23/the-ethics-of-honoring/) as well? If we can object to honoring someone who was racist, can we object to honoring someone who committed adultery (eg. [Einstein](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jul/11/internationalnews))?

* Has fandom and fanfiction existed historically, or is it a new thing? Short answer: [historical](http://michaelblume.tumblr.com/post/131849560304/persian-slipper-teashoesandhair-ogress).

* Together with the student protests on campus, students have also demanded that schools [rename infrastructure currently named after racists/sexists](http://dailynous.com/2015/11/23/the-ethics-of-honoring/). [Including Woodrow Wilson](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/names-in-the-ivy-league).

* "Think about the last time you felt stressed or low in mood. Did thinking about it help?" Er, yes. I'm stressed or in a bad mood *because of problems I'm facing*. They don't just spontaneously come and go (for me; I understand that depression is that way). [That is a terrible motivation of mindfulness](http://claritypsych.com.au/whats-the-deal-with-mindfulness/). Here's [a better motivation](https://youtu.be/pVTDMA8w2m0?t=43s).

* A [codex vitae](http://wayoftheduck.com/codex-vitae) is a book of everything you've learned over your life. I wonder how that's different from keeping a journal, at least one in which more academic thoughts are included.

* Do people *really* [believe that the law is politically neutral](http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite/MythWeb.htm)? This seems obvious to me, and is merely a specific instance of the more general observation that *all* man-made rules are arbitrary. They should all be considered before being followed.

* I am much more enthusiastic about the idea of [work-life integration](https://medium.com/life-travel-work/f-ck-work-life-balance-8b575bb9084a) than work-life balance.

* With so many things running on software, how do we know that the software is correct? Particularly when [the software matches DNA from crime scenes](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/secret-source-code-pronounces-you-guilty-as-charged/)?

* The path of science is not straight, or: how a step forward in one area may lead to a step backward in another. As an example, [the cause of scurvy](http://www.idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm).

* If everyone knows that psychologists (and their confederates) are lying liars, [are psychology experiments still meaningful](https://aeon.co/essays/is-it-ok-for-psychologists-to-deceive-their-test-subjects)?

* In climbing, a "first female ascent" is the first woman to climb a route. I, too, am ambivalent about [whether that's truly an achievement to be celebrated](http://eveningsends.com/climbing/the-curse-of-the-first-female-ascent/).

* [Assigning homework may not be useful](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2012/11/26/homework-an-unnecessary-evil-surprising-findings-from-new-research/?postshare=4631445780707731). This is definitely true of elementary school, but even in high school the effects of homework are small. I would like to see if different *types* of homework all produce this result, or if "homework" from a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) are equally useless.
