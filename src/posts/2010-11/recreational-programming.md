Title: Recreational Programming

The result of about 10 hours of recreational programming: a web
interface to settle complex bills. This was common when I went on
camping trips; people would pay for gas, camping, firewood, etc. willy
nilly, and at the end it's always a pain to figure out who owes what. No
longer.
