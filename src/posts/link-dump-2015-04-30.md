* There's a space shoot-'em-up where you fire your lasers by [making "pew pew pew" noises](http://www.touch-code-magazine.com/new-innovative-iphone-game-pew-pew-starblast-live-on-app-store/).

* I'm not sure I entirely buy this theory that [people hit ceilings in their mathematical ability because they missed some crucial lesson early on](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/04/08/the-math-ceiling-wheres-your-cognitive-breaking-point/). Speaking personally, I don't necessarily feel like I hit a ceiling with differential equations (the last hard math class I took). It feels more like that I hadn't spent sufficient time on the subject, and at this point have little incentive to do so. 

* A semi-truck overturned on I-5 (in Washington State) and spilled what it was carrying. Its contents? [40 million bees](http://q13fox.com/2015/04/17/semi-truck-carrying-more-than-40-million-bees-overturns-on-i-5-wsp-warns-drivers/).

* The best crossword solvers can finish a New York Times Friday puzzle, on average, in under six minutes (5:38, to be precise). The Monday puzzle averages out to 1:40... [about the same time it took a layman to fill the squares with their name](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dan-feyer-american-crossword-puzzle-tournament/).

* [A list of problem-solving strategies for programmers](http://kevinlawler.com/prompts). I've thought about creating a chat bot interface to mind mapping that does this, doing surface-level natural language processing to generate new, context-specific prompts. [The code is on Github](https://github.com/justinnhli/myalocartis), although I haven't touched it in a while.

* [A beautiful visualization and explanation](https://vimeo.com/110348926) of the UK airspace and it's 6000 daily flights.

* [Wingception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg0TXNXgz-w); Or, How Do Airplanes Fly.

* Pokemon Yellow (as sold for the Game Boy) [is Turing complete](http://aurellem.org/vba-clojure/html/total-control.html) - as in, within the game, you can perform a sequence of "legal" actions that would turn the "game" into any other computer program you want.

* ["Card Juggling"](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/inside-elegant-mesmerizing-subculture-card-juggling/)

* [Stanford's CS 106A has 700 students.](http://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/04/16/a-look-at-stanford-computer-science-part-ii-challenges-of-a-growing-field/). As does Michigan's EECS 183 - and enrollment is expected to go up to 1000 in the fall.

* As indoor bouldering moves further and further away from the shapes found in real rock, [is it becoming a different sport](http://thestonemind.com/2015/04/21/on-the-evolution-of-plastic/)? Has (should) it [merge with parkour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bHF5Yfu_jQ)? Or be [something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Lil72g8nE) [else](https://youtu.be/opqfg6vkIH8?t=2m19s)?

* When can a professor give an F? And when can the administration intervene? [Failing an entire class](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/04/27/professor-fails-his-entire-class-and-his-university-intervenes) is probably over-reacting, but what *should* a faculty do if they fail a student, but the grade is then changed by the administration (due to, say, athletic reasons?).

* From William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience (emphasis mine): "Give up the feeling of responsibility, let go your hold, resign the care of your destiny to higher powers, *be genuinely indifferent to what becomes of it all*, and you will find not only that you gain a perfect inward relief, but often also, in addition, *the particular goods you sincerely thought you were renouncing*." Well chosen quote for [how corporate American meditates](http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-long-marriage-of-mindfulness-and-money).

* I've always wondered how we deal with bugs in gambling software. Apparently it's enough for the casino to say "Sorry, software glitch!", then [refuse to pay out](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/26/sorry-grandma-that-42-million-slot-machine-jackpot-was-a-computer-glitch/).

* Video games create a lot of cool, picturesque virtual worlds, that are often left desolate soon after new games come out. [Here's a tour of some such locations in World of Warcraft](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/forgotten-wonders-of-the-digital-world-world-of-warcraft). This reminds me of a conversation from Daniel Saurez's Freedom, between the MMORPG avatars of two characters: "[This place] lies beneath the kingdom of Avelar. It's called the Cave of Forgotten Kings. Built from what remained of a sunken city. Phosphorescent moss made this cave livable after thousands of years of glacial erosion. [...] What do you mean, 'wow'? What I just said was complete rubbish. This is a bunch of bitmap textures wrapped around a 3-D model."

* We need to be okay with mediocre female engineers, 'cause [we're okay with mediocre male engineers all the time](https://medium.com/@amyngyn/i-need-terrible-female-engineers-1023a2e973dd).

* What I find curious about transphobia is that people are not repulsed by the product (ie. the body of the transgendered person), but by the *history* of that product (ie. that the body used to be of a different gender). This is why [people would catcall a woman to begin with, then deride them after learning she's trans](http://www.nylon.com/articles/american-reflexxx-video). I really want to know how people would justify their change in attitude.

* A high school friend of mine got featured in [a Poynter article about online journalism](http://www.poynter.org/news/media-innovation/339083/stephen-suen-learn-to-talk-about-code/).

* If you're still stuck in the 2048 craze: you can stop now. [AI's get easily get up to the 16384 tile](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/).

* UPenn has a course titled ["Wasting Time on the Internet"](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/04/kenneth_goldsmith_and_penn_s_wasting_time_on_the_internet_course.html). I actually think it's a good idea, although I object to it being classified as a writing course.

* I'm about to start a second blog, and am also about to start writing my thesis, and I wonder if I can [get into the habit of writing continuously](http://climbingnarc.com/2015/04/rhythm/). Of course, I have also been keeping a personal journal for 13 years, but that seems different from public writing somehow.
