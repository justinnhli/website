Something about this being the 100th post.

You should check out the comments to my [stalker
post](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/12/guide-to-stalking-by-example.html).

Following Henry's example, I googled my username. Most of the sites I
know, but I also found a link from
[www.logic-math.information-eg.com](http://209.85.175.104/search?q=cache:U-Gp7OdSVGAJ:www.logic-math.information-eg.com/logic/theorem/posts/8+ninghui48&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=17).
The actual page has changed, so that link is to Google's cache.

What a strange place for my blog to show up.

Another strange place for my blog to show up is the [search results for
"infinite grid of ideal one ohm
resistors"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=infinite%20grid%20of%20ideal%20one%20ohm%20resistors)
without quotes.

Finally, [another funny
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hedY97tVRCk) from
[Courtney](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/11/wall-e.html). I
personally think it's genius.
