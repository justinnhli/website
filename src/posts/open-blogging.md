Title: Open Blogging

I've noticed that not only do I write more often (probably adding up to
the same if not larger amount of text) in Blogger, but I also write in a
different style. It's probably because it feels like no one reads this,
and so I take on a more playful personality. I also don't feel like I'm
constrained to talking about my life, and share other nerdy things. Or
more feelings, like this post.

Case in point: the last post. I can't remember the last time I used the
phrase "Just Kidding"
