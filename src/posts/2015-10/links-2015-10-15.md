* Some video games [now have architects involved](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DeannaVanBuren/20151012/254238/Architecture_in_Video_Games_Designing_for_Impact.php) to design the buildings.

* How you know you're not worthy: you can't even [lift a hammer that contains an electromagnet](http://www.cnet.com/news/engineer-builds-working-thors-hammer-only-he-can-lift/). Although, if you put it in an elevator...

* Crocs (the shoe company) [used someone's Instagram picture](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/media/retailers-use-of-their-fans-photos-draws-scrutiny.html) in their feed without permission, raising privacy concerns. Question: who owns the intellectual property of an Instagram? Are companies/others allowed to use it for advertising, even if there is no immediate commercial gain? What about tweets, and how they are now used on live TV?

* A colleague at Oxy was involved in the recent large-scale replication studies, and here's [the experience from one of the authors that was replicated](http://mindingthebrain.blogspot.fr/2015/09/reproducibility-project-front-row-seat.html)

* The bar code on boarding passes turns out to [contain a lot of personal information](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/10/whats-in-a-boarding-pass-barcode-a-lot/). From now on I'm going dispose of mine a lot more carefully.

* The only [fictional female murderer-for-fun](http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/where-are-the-female-thrill-killers-in-fiction/) I can think of is Xenia Onatopp from Goldeneye.

* There was an article a while back about how [people would rather get electrical shocks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/07/03/most-men-would-rather-shock-themselves-than-be-alone-with-their-thoughts/) than be left alone to their thoughts. Which is why people [dislike boredom](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/9/harvard-curtail-cs50-campaign/), especially since it's something people [don't have a lot of anymore](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/28/boredom-cures-privilege-free-mind).

* Do people honestly think that we pick jobs [based *solely* on salary](http://ideas.ted.com/whats-the-most-satisfying-job-in-the-world-youd-be-surprised/)?
