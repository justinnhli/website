I just came back from a art cinema thing, where they showcased some
early (pre-1970) computer animation. It wasn't as interesting as I
thought it would be, but I did have thoughts about that. First, that
visualization didn't really develop much in the past 50 years. Second,
that distortion of a 2D image can make it seem as though it's 3D and
rotating. Finally, I encourage everyone to check out Larry Cuba's
Calculated Movements. It would make a pretty cool screen saver.
