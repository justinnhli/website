* The [existence of poor quality comments](https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/the-troll-down-the-hall-what-do-academic-blog-comments-reveal-about-our-colleagues/) in the Chronicle of Higher Education just goes to show that every community has problems. (That's me being stoic.)

* How a professor got tenure [because of his "disabled" child](http://matt.might.net/articles/tenure/).

* [Philosophers on the Ashley Madison hack](http://dailynous.com/2015/08/24/philosophers-on-the-ashley-madison-hack/). I wish there would be a "philosophers on modern relationships".

* A good [parable about privilege](https://sindeloke.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/37/).

* Coca-Cola funds a lot of research into obesity, mostly pushing the message that [people should exercise more](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/). Is there a name for the fallacy of using absolute instead of relative benefits in a resource-constrained environment? That is, it's not so much about whether exercise helps (yes it does) but whether it helps *more* than a good diet (no it doesn't). Something about an opportunity cost bias?

* A review of a fascinating podcast about the intersection of [food, imperialism, and technology](http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2015/8/18/cuisine-and-empire).

* In defense of [1859 BCE + 8463 feet + 118 people = 10440](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/08/19/the-smartest-dumb-error-in-the-great-state-of-colorado/). I have to wonder though: why add them? You could just as well multiply the numbers, or take the exponent - or god forbid, [use them as arguments in a nested Busy Beaver function](http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html).

* Every year, professors at Beloit College [publish a "Mindset List"](http://www.beloit.edu/mindset/2019/) that describes the world that the incoming college freshmen class grew up. The one that scares me a little is #36: "First Responders have always been heroes". This presumably refers to 9/11, which occurred when the born-in-1997 freshmen were about four years old. *They literally don't remember a time before the war on terror.*

* The EU has a right-to-be-forgotten law, which requires that Google (and other internet services) accept requests for certain links to be deleted. Google [has now been ordered to delete the links to pages *about* the links it deleted](http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2015/08/google-ordered-to-remove-links-to-stories-about-google-removing-links-to-stories/).

* A really cool graph showing how [median income is correlated with the gender ratio of college majors](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/08/16/u-s-college-majors-median-yearly-earnings-vs-gender-ratio/).

* I don't understand why stun guns [might be an exception to the right to bear arms](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/you-have-the-right-to-bear-arms-but-what-about-electrical-arms-or-stun-guns/). The argument seems to be that, because they are non-lethal, they cannot be used in a military setting... and therefore in the context of the second amendment, cannot be used in a rebellion against a totalitarian government. The argument I want to try is, given that governments have GPS-guided missiles, either: 1) normal firearms are also useless, and therefore are not protected by the second amendment, or 2) regular citizens should be allowed to own and operator guided missiles.

* I've always liked the idea of typography as a field of study, because it's subtle and aesthetic but also scientific - much in the same way that architecture is. Typography usually brings to mind the design of typefaces, but [here's a talk about the design of documents](https://vimeo.com/73444208), and how the constraints of the web - or rather, the *lack* of constraints of the web - presents new challenges that typographers and authoring tools have yet to meet.

* A problem I will eventually have to deal with: [how do we cope with the growing number of computer science students](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/08/ways-to-deal-with-growing-number-of-cs.html)?

* For a while colleges were really into Second Life and built virtual classrooms to be used. They are of course all abandoned now, but [the structures still exist for perusal](http://fusion.net/story/181901/we-took-a-tour-of-the-abandoned-college-campuses-of-second-life/).

* [The problem with the "leaky pipeline" metaphor](http://biochembelle.com/2013/08/28/the-pipeline-isnt-leaky/) in STEM education is that, first, it assumes people want to get a tenure-track position, and second, it doesn't take into account how people get into STEM. Plus, [the pipeline metaphor doesn't apply to post-bachelor transitions anyway](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00037/abstract).

* [Philosophers on decriminalizing prostitution](http://dailynous.com/2015/08/13/philosophers-on-prostitutions-decriminalization/).

* One common piece of knowledge you hear about in psychology/neuroscience classes is that language is processed specially in the brain, by several regions in the left hemisphere. Turns out that this pattern [may not be true of whistled Turkish](http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/the-curious-case-of-whistled-languages-and-their-lack-of-left-brain-dominance/). (That whistled Turkish exists in the first place is kind of wonderful.)

* I have gotten increasingly interested in how technology may be biased due to cultural factors, and here's an example of [how machine learning may also be suspect](https://medium.com/@mrtz/how-big-data-is-unfair-9aa544d739de).
