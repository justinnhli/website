For some reason I kinda like the [genre of
cyberpunk](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/11/in-beginning-was-command-line.html).
I haven't read a lot of literature or watched a lot of movies in the
area, but I like the idea. The film the Matrix, the anime series Ghost
in a Shell, books like the Neuromancer, all fall in this category. In my
(perhaps misinformed) opinion, cyberpunk says something philosophical
about humans in a world of machines and telecommunications.

I had a thought about that today. I had [written about
PostSecret](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/11/im-shy-not-antisocial.html)
before; recently my dorm did a similar event, with residents writing on
cards and the cards being posted in our lobby. I would like to share
some of them:

-   I eavesdrop constantly and I don't feel bad about it.
-   I almost cheated on my girlfriend on Thanksgiving.
-   I'm scared I will never be loved or love someone. I (heart) u.
-   I'm afraid I'm actually a terrible person inside.
-   I just found out that I have HIV. I've been having unprotected sex
    for a year. I still haven't told my girlfriend.

Not all the secrets are sobering, of course. But I look at the cards,
and besides wondering who wrote these words, I also wonder why people
are so compelled to keep secrets and then let them out anonymously like
that. It's sort of the same thing with the internet, of course:
anonymity behind statements. Some people say it allows them to be judged
by their inner qualities, as opposed to their physical appearance.

I think the fact that people post secrets like this shows the world is
lacking deeper human connections.
