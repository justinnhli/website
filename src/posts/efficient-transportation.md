Last week's question: Are outdoor ice rinks really made with water? Is
Zamboni a type of vehicle or a brand name?

-   Yes, out door ice rinks are made with water. When I went ice skating
    last weekend, we talked about mixing some kind of chemical to raise
    the melting point of water, so it will freeze more easily. I suspect
    this will make it turn to liquid quicker under pressure though.
-   Zamboni is a brand name, with their major competitor being Olympia.
    The latter is what Millennium Park uses.

This week's question: In physics, we often do problems where the ground
has no friction, so there is no loss in energy. Now, imagine a world
where the ground (and only the ground, not buildings or other artificial
objects) have no friction. What would the transportation system in such
a world look like? Hint: cars move because of friction between the tyres
and the ground.
