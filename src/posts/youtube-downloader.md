Just a word: if you ever wanted to download a video from Youtube, you
can use <http://vixy.net/>. It's open source, and so it's probably going
to stay free, and you can convert the video to several different
formats.<span id="formatbar_Buttons" style="display:block;"><span
id="formatbar_CreateLink" class="on down" style="display:block;"
title="Link">  
The [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCnZYdC73qo) I wanted to
download is for one of my presentations... :D
