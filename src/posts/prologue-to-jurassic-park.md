I've only written once about the environment and environmental causes,
although that was in reference to [a larger
issue](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2008/01/survival-of-fittest.html).
My apathy is mentioned in passing
[elsewhere](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2008/12/big-race_19.html) as
well. I might have eventually written more on the subject, but I just
discovered that the prologue to Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (now a
major motion picture) very articulately explains my views. It is copied
below for your enjoyment.  

> You think man can destroy the planet? What intoxicating vanity. Let me
> tell you about our planet. Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old.
> There's been life on it for nearly that long, 3.8 billion years.
> Bacteria first; later the first multicellular life, then the first
> complex creatures in the sea, on the land.
>
> </p>
> Then finally the great sweeping ages of animals, the amphibians, the
> dinosaurs, at last the mammals, each one enduring millions on millions
> of years, great dynasties of creatures rising, flourishing, dying
> away -- all this against a background of continuous and violent
> upheaval. Mountain ranges thrust up, eroded away, cometary impacts,
> volcano eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole continents moving,
> an endless, constant, violent change, colliding, buckling to make
> mountains over millions of years.
>
> Earth has survived everything in its time. It will certainly survive
> us. If all the nuclear weapons in the world went off at once and all
> the plants, all the animals died and the earth was sizzling hot for a
> hundred thousand years, life would survive, somewhere: under the soil,
> frozen in Arctic ice. Sooner or later, when the planet was no longer
> inhospitable, life would spread again. The evolutionary process would
> begin again. It might take a few billion years for life to regain its
> present variety.
>
> Of course, it would be very different from what it is now, but the
> earth would survive our folly, only we would not. If the ozone layer
> gets thinner, ultraviolet radiation sears the earth, so what?
> Ultraviolet radiation is good for life. It's powerful energy. It
> promotes mutation, change. Many forms of life will thrive with more UV
> radiation. Many others will die out. Do you think this is the first
> time that's happened? Think about oxygen. Necessary for life now, but
> oxygen is actually a metabolic poison, a corrosive glass, like
> fluorine.
>
> When oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant
> cells some three billion years ago, it created a crisis for all other
> life on earth. Those plants were polluting the environment, exhaling a
> lethal gas. Earth eventually had an atmosphere incompatible with life.
> Nevertheless, life on earth took care of itself. In the thinking of
> the human being a hundred years is a long time.
>
> A hundred years ago we didn't have cars, airplanes, computers or
> vaccines. It was a whole different world, but to the earth, a hundred
> years is nothing. A million years is nothing. This planet lives and
> breathes on a much vaster scale. We can't imagine its slow and
> powerful rhythms, and we haven't got the humility to try. We've been
> residents here for the blink of an eye. If we're gone tomorrow, the
> earth will not miss us.
