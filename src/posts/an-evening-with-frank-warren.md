Frank Warren, the guy behind
[PostSecret](http://postsecret.blogspot.com/), visited Ann Arbor on
Friday. He travels and gives talks on PostSecret, and having followed
that blog for over two years now, I thought I would go and listen to him
speak.

This is the first time I've been to any sort of ticketed event. I've
never been to concerts (except free ones), or improv theaters (at least
not by myself).

If people are not familiar with PostSecret, it's an online social art
project. People from all over the world send postcards to Frank.
Sometimes the postcards are hand made, other times they're bought, but
they share one feature: the sender has written a secret on the postcard.
Frank then chooses 20 or so each week (he gets hundreds) to put on the
blog, as well as some email responses people have had.

For his talks, he spends some time talking about the origins of the
project, then sharing some secrets which were never posted or published
in his books, and talks more about the [appeal of human
connection](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2009/04/stranger-appeal.html).
At the end, people from the audience are encouraged to share their
secrets on the spot.

Personally, I thought the two hours spent was well spent, although the
event overall could be better. Although I applaud Frank from coming up
with the idea, when people read PostSecret it's really for what people
have poured their heart out on. The catharsis is from reading the
secrets, and knowing that other people have the same thoughts, feelings,
and fears that you do. Knowing that, I wish Frank would have allotted
more time for the audience to contribute, to build the conversation in
the moment, as opposed to talking about how PostSecret came to be. He's
not a bad speaker - he has done this hundreds of times before, and gets
the audience to laugh when he wants them to - but it's also missing the
heart of why his project is so successful.

Nothing that Frank said had much affect on me. I was more affected by a
secret that someone in the audience shared, which made me feel warm and
euphoric, as though I had been drinking. It was a girl, who told the
story of answering the phone one day and talking to the stranger on the
other end for hours. At the end, as they were about to hang up, the
stranger told her, "thankyou for talking to me. I was going to kill
myself before I dialed a random number..." While telling the story, the
girl's voice cracked and started sobbing, no doubt reliving the powerful
effect that experience had on her. As Frank pointed out, people are just
looking for someone to listen, to show that they care.

Since I haven't had a complete post on PostSecret before, I thought I
would also share some of the secrets which resonated with me from the
blog. My old dorm did do a similar event, and you can [read some of what
my (really) immediate neighbors
wrote](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2007/11/cyberpunk.html). These are
from the official site:

-   "I want to tell you that i love you, but I'm afraid of the silence
    that might follow."
-   "I am afraid that the person I would love and myself will never
    meet, since we would both be too introverted to introduce
    ourselves."
-   "Today I realized I could no longer remember what you were like when
    you still loved me."
-   "I am a virgin. I've had three girls offer me free, easy,
    no-commitment sex. But I turned them all down, because I'm in love
    with a beautiful girl who just wants to be friends."

These next two were displayed in the same post. I thought it showed
something about humans and love.

-   "I lost my virginity last night to a boy who doesn't love me... And
    all I care about is how I'm going to have to lie to people when they
    ask me if I'm still a virgin."
-   "You thought you lost your /virginity/ that night. I never had the
    heart to tell you... /It was only my hand/."

This one I thought a little strange, because it implied that love
doesn't require respect:

-   "I love my wife, but I don't respect her, because she's not very
    smart."

Some more:

-   "Whenever a stranger stands by me, or passes, I wonder what's on
    their mind and when they walk away, I secretly miss them."
-   "Everywhere I look people have found someone to share their lives
    with. I don't think anyone is looking for me."

I do this too, and more than just near Valentine's:

-   "Every Valentine's Day, I go to Papyrus to rip off their card
    ideas."

And even more:

-   "I didn't take your virginity because I felt it was going to end and
    I love you so much I wanted it to be special for you."
-   "If I could go back in time, I'd go back to all the times we almost
    kissed... and I'd kiss you."
-   "I have pretended to be happy for so long. I don't know if I'm still
    pretending."
-   "I love you and I know you are going to hurt me. I resent that you
    will hurt me, but I don't know what to do."
-   "The best decision I ever made was letting you love me."

And my personal favorite:

-   "We accept the love we think we deserve."
