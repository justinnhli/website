I have another post in the writing, but I want so share my discovery
that my [experiment on
Craigslist](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2010/05/cross-acting.html) is
no unique. At least two other people have done it before: [Simon
Owens](http://bloggasm.com/you-chances-of-getting-laid-through-craigslist-a-bloggasm-case-study),
whose results were "tame" like mine, and [Jason
Fortuny](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504025232rn_2/blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2006/09/craigslist.html?entry_id=1553329),
who posted [all the replies he
got](http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/RFJason_CL_Experiment/Replies)
on [Encyclopedia
Dramatica](http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/RFJason_CL_Experiment)
(both of these are **definitely NSFW**). I believe several people lost
their job over the Fortuny case, and more had to deal with problems in
their family.

On the ethics over Fortuny's case, I happen to think he should not be
punished. Legal considerations aside, I think the fault lies mostly on
the people who replied to his ad for giving personal information to a
stranger on the Internet. Without evidence otherwise, the worst case
assumption should always be made.

That said, I don't think Fortuny is a shining example of how humans
should act, either.
