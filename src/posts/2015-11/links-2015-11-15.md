* [College](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/11/myth-of-the-fragile-college-student.html) [free speech](http://chronicle.com/article/When-Pursuing-Diversity/234190) [everywhere](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/the-new-intolerance-of-student-activism-at-yale/414810/).

* A really cool exercise in gender descriptions: using [latent semantic analysis to identify equivalent descriptions](http://bookworm.benschmidt.org/posts/2015-10-30-rejecting-the-gender-binary.html) of professors in student reviews.

* [Google lies](http://gizmodo.com/why-people-keep-trying-to-erase-the-hollywood-sign-from-1658084644) about where you can see the Hollywood sign.

* I have a thing for [video games](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/2dark-a-game-thats-all-about-saving-and-killing-children/) that partially [play the player](http://eev.ee/blog/2015/11/08/undertale/).

* I similarly enjoy phone apps that get you to [try to destroy your phone](http://www.wired.com/2013/09/send-me-to-heaven-app).

* What happens [if you die](https://medium.com/matter/living-and-dying-on-airbnb-6bff8d600c04) while staying in someone else's house through Airbnb?

* [Social networks are bad for you](https://medium.com/@GOODROOT/social-networks-are-bad-for-you-5a341d0aafa1)... except [stop saying that](https://medium.com/digital-culturist/stop-saying-technology-is-causing-social-isolation-1e004de63a5e). It's interesting that the two articles actually agree on how social networks allow you to keep old connections alive.

* If you are interested in making new connections instead, maybe [this adult dorm](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/coliving/414531/) may help.

* Taylor Swift [was interviewed](http://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story) by a reporter who suggests she has every reply and movement calculated. The interview itself fails to shake that idea.

* ["I'm just not a Spanish person."](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/11/04/if-we-talked-about-other-subjects-the-way-we-talk-about-math/) - replacing what people say about math with other subjects. Some of these I feel might actually be negligence on the teacher's part though.

* Related: students should struggle to learn the command line [because it teaches grit](https://medium.com/@eytanadar/on-the-value-of-command-line-bullshittery-94dc19ec8c61). There is something to be said for the command line being a safe place to do so, but I'm not convinced that students can't learn the same thing by doing more interesting projects.

* I use [number 3 on this list](https://medium.com/conquering-corporate-america/10-tricks-to-appear-smart-during-meetings-27b489a39d1a) *all the time* to appear smart. Wait, did I say that out loud?

* I'll believe that the [common core is right](https://medium.com/i-math/why-5-x-3-5-5-5-was-marked-wrong-b34607a5b74c) and the student who wrote "5*3" instead of "3*5" is wrong when I hear a fifth grade teacher explain the commutative property to their class. Given the state of US education, I find it ironic that the posts ends on "Respect the Teachers. They are qualified experts on child education."
