Title: Dolphins!

Some of you may recall I did a project last year where I had to design a
toy for the dolphins at Shedd Aquarium (for those who don't, here's a
[magazine article about
us](http://magazine.mccormick.northwestern.edu/sp2008/Shedd_Aquarium.html);
I look absolutely horrible in that picture). Another team recently
finished that project, with a working apparatus. It's a little weird
knowing that I came up with an idea, and a year later it's in physical
form.

Anyway, during those two quarters I learned to sketch dolphins, and did
a few sketches in my notes. I've forgotten how to do them already, but
when I was reclaiming an old notebook I found the sketches, so I thought
I'd put them online.

They're on my DeviantArt gallery:

There's also a [quick
sketch](http://justinnhli.deviantart.com/art/Canyonlands-118710510)
which I did at Canyonlands, my only personal souvenir (I have 4.5 GB of
pictures and videos from other people on the trip).

I challenge you to find time and create some art, however bad it is.
