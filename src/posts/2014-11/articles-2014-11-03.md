Title: Articles I've Read (2014-11-03)
Date: 2014-11-03

* [Computers have trouble with the many human languages](http://garrett.damore.org/2014/10/your-language-sucks.html). I really dislike the author's tone of "Asian languages suck", which I think is mostly in jest. Still, human languages were here first. I do wonder how text would be represented differently if computers were invented in China.

* I don't really feel [reading insecurity](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/09/reading_insecurity_the_crippling_fear_that_the_digital_age_has_left_you.html). In fact, I probably read more now than I did before I was a heavy internet user, even if most of what I read are shorter articles instead of books.

* The [problem with MOOCs](http://hechingerreport.org/content/ed-tech-promoters-need-understand-us-learn_16821/) is that (1) (most) people [don't know what they need to know](http://computinged.wordpress.com/2014/10/18/learners-dont-know-whats-best-for-them/), and (2) (most) people are not reflective enough to find out.

* I never realized that [Cantonese has its own proverbs](http://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/) separate from what people usually consider [Chinese proverbs/idioms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengyu).

* [I don't dance](https://medium.com/@henryreich/please-respect-my-decision-not-to-dance-e19d1b6ae482).

* Everyone who thinks about gender issues should watch this [video of street harassment](http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/10/street-harassment-caught-on-camera.html)...

* ..and maybe [help expose people who are online harassers](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/10/rise-of-the-feminist-creep-busting-web-vigilante/381809/).

* A researcher hypothesizes that [age is just a mindset](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/magazine/what-if-age-is-nothing-but-a-mind-set.html), that if we trick our brain into believing that we're young, the body responds according. 

* Speaking of neuroscience, the reason the Ship of Theseus is paradoxical is because [we believe identities can only have one examplar](http://scientiasalon.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/identity-a-neurobiological-perspective/).

* I will buy dinner for whoever explains the general case for [this mathematical puzzle](http://fawnnguyen.com/multiplication-finding-the-greatest-product/).
