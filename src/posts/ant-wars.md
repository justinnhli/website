I want to build a game based on emergence/complexity principles. I'm
going to call it Ant Wars.

This will be a programming game, with a twist: you only have indirect
control over your army. Each unit, an ant, will have the exact same
code, so that their behavior is localized. The players are not allowed
to define global variables, or in fact anything global at all. The point
of the game is to eliminate the opposing ant colony. Each colony starts
with a certain amount of food, and when there's no food left, it will
die. There may be food resources on the battlefield, and dead ants will
also turn into a food source.

We'll see how this goes.
