Here's something new: a musical instrument which requires no physical
contact at all.

The [Theremin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) is actually an old
instrument, invented in the 1910s. Wikipedia will tell you all about it.
I just stumbled upon (haha) it while reading from
[gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/), where a motor was used to control the
instrument.

Here are some great videos of the Theremin

of the best videos I found. Her [Wikipedia

information.
