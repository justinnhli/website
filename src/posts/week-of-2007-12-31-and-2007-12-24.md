I'm back in Chicago. I was hoping it would be all snowing and nice, but
the snow's all melted, and I think there's been a few days when Hong
Kong was colder this break. Sad.

In these two weeks I:

-   Watched American Gangster, Atonement, and Da Vinci Code. I liked
    Atonement the best. Da Vinci Code had a significantly different back
    story than in the book, which church-ified the story a bit. American
    Gangster was a good story.
-   Hung out with my friends. I will miss them; this is the least
    willingly I've left Hong Kong since the start of college.

That's about it... boring holidays huh. Maybe classes will bring some
challenge into my life...
