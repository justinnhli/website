My [Moleskine
notebook](http://www.moleskine.net/eng/_interni/catalogo/Cat_int/catalogo_notebooks.htm),
which I've only been using for a few months, is starting to break. The
bottom of the spine is broken off on one side, and it will probably
continue.

I can't really say whether it's bad manufacturing, or if it's because I
stuff it in my pockets too roughly. But I mean, if I don't keep my
notebook in my pocket, where should I keep it? I don't always have a
backpack with me.

I'm thinking next time I'll use those [set-of-3
cahiers](http://www.moleskine.net/eng/_interni/catalogo/Cat_int/catalogo_cahiers.htm)
instead of one single hardcover notebook; it would probably last better
for the "rough" treatment I put it through.

On the other hand, has anyone tried the new paperback notebooks? Are
they any good?
