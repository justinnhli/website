Here are a few gems of wisdom imparted from a class I'm taking:

-   Being part of a team means having integrity and honesty, to yourself
    and others.
-   It's not a good company that tries to keep people on its campus for
    as long as possible. It's a good company if a guy comes around
    telling people to go home.
-   You need chaos to do anything creative, but you need order to
    present the results of that creativeness
-   When dealing with people, everything has a purpose; focus on that
    and not the details.
-   Always use the largest bandwidth communication channel possible.
-   It is better for a team to be consistently good than unpredictably
    excellent.
