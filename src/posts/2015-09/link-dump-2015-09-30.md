* It's weird to me that someone can report something (in this case, sexual harassment), then have the result be so severe that [the original report regrets it](http://www.vice.com/read/i-regret-reporting-my-female-boss-for-sexual-harassment-657). *Something* is wrong with this picture, and I honestly don't know what.

* Sharing between strangers is a good idea... [it just turns out that it's not worth the effort](http://www.fastcompany.com/3050775/the-sharing-economy-is-dead-and-we-killed-it).

* Sometimes I hear [academic horror stories](http://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9261531/professor-quitting-job) and wonder if one day I'll be swayed by them.

* New York City is requiring that [computer science classes be available to all high school students](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/nyregion/de-blasio-to-announce-10-year-deadline-to-offer-computer-science-to-all-students.html) within 10 years.

* Is [teaching with lectures](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/opinion/sunday/are-college-lectures-unfair.html), compared to teaching with active learning, unfair? [No](http://blog.chabris.com/2015/09/no-college-lectures-are-not-unfair.html). (By the way, [Betteridge's law of headlings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines))

* Computer science is [stealing students who would otherwise do statistics](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/08/statistics-losing-ground-to-cs-losing-image-among-students.html).

* One professor teaches a "Literature of 9/11" class. Guess what happens. [Hint: it involves the internet](http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article35735889.html).

* [What to do if you're involved in a Title IX complaint](https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/title-ix-a-step-by-step-guide/). Warning: this is depressing as shit.

* An argument for critics of online education to teach online courses: [so our psychological anchor for online education quality is not set by early adopters](https://chroniclevitae.com/news/1127-somebody-s-gotta-do-it)

* In a different life I would totally have gotten into [letterpressing](http://craftsmanship.net/the-art-of-letterpress-printing/).

* A powerful and obvious [series of pictures](http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2015/9/22/there-is-no-nofilter) on how we distort reality on social media.

* For families, college is increasingly being considered a financial investment instead of being just education. Which is fine, given the amount of debt that students may take on. But [where does student effort fit in](http://chronicle.com/article/Why-College-Is-Not-a-Commodity/233011/)? Clearly students are not *just* paying for the diploma (or at least, I hope they aren't). Is the college experience part of that monetary exchange (and what portion of it is the experience versus the diploma)? Or are you paying for the opportunities you get in college? For example, you can climb Everest for $80,000, but you have to do the actual walking, and they keep your money if you quit. Is that a good analogy for college?

* Finally! Some recognition for [the subtle art of setting climbing routes](http://www.outsideonline.com/2017711/path-beta-flash-resistance-route-setters). I still think that has a lot of similarities with writing problem sets (...which I'm struggling with right now).

* Many colleges are facing the tension between meritocracy and diversity in their student body. Washington College's response: [allow urban youth to submit applications as in groups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/09/28/one-colleges-new-recruiting-strategy-allow-urban-youth-to-apply-in-groups/).

* Speaking of meritocracy versus diversity, Berkeley students recently wrote an open letter against [their computer science program requiring a higher GPA](http://www.dailycal.org/2015/09/01/campus-computer-science-program-does-not-compute/). I applaud them for speaking out.

* [There is water on Mars](http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/09/mars-gets-salty-shows-seasonal-features-tied-to-flows-of-liquid-water/).

* There are many arguments about how most pornography is bad, for a number of possible reasons. But the question remains: [can porn be art](http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/06/can-pornography-be-art), at least in some cases?
