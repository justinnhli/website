Title: Blogspot Spellcheck

Those of you who read my previous post on <span
style="background-color:yellow;">hangboards</span> before this might
have noticed the strange yellow highlighting. It's fixed now, but it
turns out that the <span
style="background-color:yellow;">spellcheck</span> in the Blogger
compose box actually *modifies* the contents, by inserting span tags
like these:

<span class="goog-spellcheck-word"
style="background:none repeat scroll 0 0 yellow;">errorr</span>

And so, if you click <span
style="background-color:yellow;">spellcheck</span>, then publish it
without clicking again, those highlights will be published along with
the post. The resulting post will look something like this post.
