Apparently all my other drafts require lots of writing, and since I have
a midterm in... an hour or so, my contribution today will be short.

When I go around every day, I keep a small bag of change with me. I
don't really buy stuff that often, but it has come in handy before. The
problem I face is that I don't want to carry too much change, but want
enough so I don't get coins in return. I found a website several weeks
ago (probably during new student week) talking about what's the minimum
number of coins you need to give exact change, and I thought I should
share that.

-   3 quarters
-   1 dime
-   2 nickels
-   4 pennies

Which is not too bad at all to carry around, compared to, say, a
Moleskine notebook.
