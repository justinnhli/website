I was buying something the other day, and in the change was a five
dollar note. It's nothing unusual, except was stamped with, "This bill
is registered with [www.WheresGeorge.com](http://www.WheresGeorge.com)".
I went and checked it out today, and find the project somewhat
interesting.

For the curious, the bill in my hand only has one previous entry:
Norman, Oklahoma in April of this year.
