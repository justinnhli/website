No, it's not a pun, it's webpage.

Ever had to create an account to see something on the web, but don't
want to give them your real email address? You know if you sign up you
will get 20 more spam emails a day (although Gmail puts it all in one
place, so that's solved), but you really want an account just to check
that one thing.

[Mailinator.com](http://www.mailinator.com/) is your solution. Think of
it like a drop box; you tell people what your address is, and they drop
stuff there. Mainlinator allows you to create fake email accounts with
no signup, login or anything at all, and you can just check your mail
there. Besides the speed of access (you just type in your username, no
password needed), the main difference between Mailinator and normal
email providers is you can't send mail. In fact, Mailinator was built
explicitly for the purpose of using a fake email to get access
information.

It has been floating around the web for a while, but today is the first
time I thought I should use it.
