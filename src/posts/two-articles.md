Title: Two Articles

Read two articles through my feed aggregator, and I have two questions.

A [Wired
article](http://www.wired.com/culture/education/magazine/16-03/ps_sat)
asked, "z = x - y + 4.z = y - w - 3.z = w - x + 5. *Based on the system
of equations above, what is the value of z?* A) 2; B) 3; C) 4; D) 6; E)
12." The correct answer is supposed to be A, but isn't the system
indeterminant, with 4 variables but only 3 equations?

A [CNet article](http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9882460-7.html) talked
about Google giving out free voicemail messages for the homeless. The
article had statistics on the homeless - that 40% of the homeless are
unemployed (the other 60%, I'm guessing, works as manual labor), and
that the average age of a homeless person is 9 years old. What? That's
really ridiculous. If 40% of homeless people have children as the
article says, that means some of them have two children per individual.
Homeless. I'm shocked.
