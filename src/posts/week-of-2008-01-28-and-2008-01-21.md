It has been a pretty busy two weeks. I'm not sure if I'll have so much
fun (and so much stress!) again this quarter. I...

-   finally got the registrar to add me to my design class, which I have
    in fact been working my ass off. Which is why I can't sit up
    straight right now.
-   finished the first "real" version of my resume, and wrote my first
    cover letter.
-   ...and sent it off to [CTY](http://cty.jhu.edu/)! \*fingers
    crossed\*
-   went [ice
    skating](http://www.millenniumpark.org/artandarchitecture/mccormick_tribune.html),
    which I haven't done for a really long time, probably since high
    school. After that we went to a really nice cafe/chocolatier to
    escape the winter cold.
-   coded up a
    [redesign](http://cs.northwestern.edu/%7Enhl263/comp_sci_330/project2/)
    of [Doodle](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2007/10/doodles.html) for
    HCI. I really like the redesign; I think it not only looks nicer,
    but offers more information at a glance as well. Oh, and the major
    selling point, the ability to drag on the checkboxes to select
    multiple times at once. Very useful.
-   went to the swimming pool twice, again something I haven't done in a
    really long while. It wasn't for swimming though, but to test our
    [pipe-bombing-looking bubble
    makers](http://picasaweb.google.com/justinnhli/PipeBombs/photo#5162957135087148002).
-   had another adventure at another ice rink with broomball. I think
    wearing hiking boots makes it easier in a way I can't explain, since
    I slipped a lot more and fell once, which is once more than I did
    last time. I'm also wearing down more expensive shoes (I think).

Yep.
