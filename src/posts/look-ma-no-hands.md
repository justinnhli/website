As my twitter says, this exercise thing is getting to me.

I went for a morning ride today, again to the Botanic Gardens. This trip
was much shorter than the last, both in distance (20-24 miles compared
to 33 miles) and in time (160 minutes as opposed to an embarrassing 270
minutes). The reason it's shorter is because I didn't get lost this
time. Last time I went around a loop in the Skokie Lagoons before
figuring out how to continue, and I went past Church to Dempster and had
to go back.

The coolest thing about today though, is that I managed to ride without
holding onto the handlebars. I kept that going for 100 feet or so,
before having to turn a corner. BUT THAT IS SO COOL!

:D
