Last week's question: How does a low gravity environment affect a
women's menstruation?

HAHAHAHAHA.

I realized the day after that, through the comments of female friends,
that I don't know a thing about this question. I know nothing about low
gravity environments, and I know nothing about women's periods.

So instead of giving an answer, I direct you to the
[comments](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2009/02/menstruation-in-space.html#comments)
of that post. There's also a [MetaFilter
thread](http://ask.metafilter.com/60496/How-does-a-woman-menstruate-in-space)
devoted to this topic.

This week's question: why does comparative advantage typically refer to
people or countries, but not counties, states, or continents?

PS. I've been a little worried lately by the fact that I ask questions
and write posts which have nothing to do with computer science. While it
shows my wide ranging interests, I'm also afraid that I'm not learning
much in computer science. This reminds me of a Budhist lesson:

> There is a scholar had an extensive background in Buddhist Studies and
> was an expert on the Nirvana Sutra. He came to study with a master and
> after making the customary bows, asked her to teach him Zen. Then, he
> began to talk about his extensive doctrinal background and rambled on
> and on about the many sutras he had studied.
>
> The master listened patiently and then began to make tea. When it was
> ready, she poured the tea into the scholar's cup until it began to
> overflow and run all over the floor. The scholar saw what was
> happening and shouted, "Stop, stop! The cup is full; you can't get
> anymore in."

> The master stopped pouring and said: "You are like this cup; you are
> full of ideas about Buddha's Way. You come and ask for teaching, but
> your cup is full; I can't put anything in. Before I can teach you,
> you'll have to empty your cup."

I am worried that I am too comfortable with computer science that I
can't ask questions anymore.
