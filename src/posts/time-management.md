This quarter is going pretty crazily so far. From high school up till
now, I've had no trouble keeping track of my schedule in my head. Sure,
sometimes I would look ahead to make sure [my
calendar](http://justinnhli.googlepages.com/calendar.html) was correct,
or I would put in a new task to do later, but most of the time I know
what I'm doing when.

This past two weeks, however, I seem to have lost my ability. I'm in
four different project classes, resulting in a lot of meetings at
different places. I find that I constantly forget about my meetings, and
keep trying to schedule things over them.

-   I tried to have a project meeting when I had a dinner appointment
    with a friend
-   I tried to go project shopping when I had another dinner appointment
-   I planned to go rock climbing when I had to help with a group coding
    session
-   I planned to go rock climbing (again) when I had a group meeting

You know what that means? It means I should upgrade my brain. Buy pack
of neurons, rig up the synaptic connections, probably get a new and
faster charger as well so I can stay awake for longer. Um. Need to visit
[US
Robots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Robots_and_Mechanical_Men).
