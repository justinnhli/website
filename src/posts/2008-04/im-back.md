Title: I'm Back!

So I'm back from spring break. It's been a pretty incredibly week, and I
sort of wish it didn't have to end so quickly. But I've already gone to
class today, and I know I have to face school again.

Sigh.

I have yet to turn all my Moleskine notes into journal entries, so for
the next few days this will be like a Twitter post.

I'm starting to like the idea of microblogging, actually. But this
allows me to write short essays, so I'll stick with this... for now.
