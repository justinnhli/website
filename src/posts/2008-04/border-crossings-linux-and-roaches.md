Stories of people's laptops being "[searched](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2007/03/crossing-border.html)" at border crossings amuse me. I particularly like the second comment on the post:

I would dearly love to do my part in confusing border agents. This is what they will see if they manage to get as far as my desktop (after a GRUB menu, lines and lines of scrolling text, and a SLiM login screen):

Not much to look at, mainly because there's not much there at all. [Fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org/), people.

In case people are curious, my wallpaper is randomly selected everytime I log in (or when I press Ctrl-Alt-Enter). All backgrounds are images by [Blatte](http://exoteric.roach.org/). I really like the guy's site, because of his fractals, but also because of his URL. He has roach.org, which is fine, and he calls himself Blatte. The connection? ["Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattaria."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach)

And the reason I know this is I once used "blattodea" (largely interchangeable with the order name) as a username for an online dating site, after someone sent me a random link to "check out her profile". Yeah...
