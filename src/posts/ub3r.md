I've always been better at numbers than with words. That doesn't mean I
can't write (I hope), but I can definitely remember numbers better than
letters or words. For shorter numbers (say, 4 digits or below), I
usually keep numbers in my mind by factoring them. I'm also better at
even numbers than odd numbers, but I don't really know why.

For longer numbers, like phone numbers or IP addresses, I have a
different system. I chunk the number in 4 digit groups, and draw them on
the number pad. So, for example, the Hong Kong phone number 51439681
would become 5143-9681. 5143 on the numpad forms something like a Greek
alpha, with a longer lower tail, while 9681 does a small quiver before
the downward stroke to 1. I mainly focus on remembering these patterns
on the numpad, and usually I will also know one or two actual numbers
for me to place it on the pad correctly.

Anyone have special ways (short of
[pegging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system)) to remember
random sequences?
