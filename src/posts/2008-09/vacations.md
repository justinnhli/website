-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1987 - Yosemite</span>. Apparently
    I've been there - just after I was conceived.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1989 - New Zealand</span>. I don't
    remember this at all, except that we visited a fire truck museum -
    which I learned from a photograph.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1991 - Florida, D.C.,
    Toronto</span>. The only thing I remember about this trip was that
    my brother bought me a Donald Duck animation flip book because I was
    asleep. I remember sitting on the side of a road flicking through
    it.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1992 - Kyushu and Tokyo,
    Japan</span>. I don't remember anything about this at all.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1993 - England, France,
    Switzerland</span>. I don't remember this either, except at on a
    snowy peak in Switzerland I threw a snowball and it in my brother in
    the face. I think he swallowed some of it.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1994 - Yellowstone National
    Park</span>. I have a vague recollection of a log cabin, and walking
    along wooden pathways above geysers. That's about it though.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1995 - Malaysia</span>. We were at a
    Club Med resort. I think I still have a hand painted T-shirt
    somewhere.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1996 - Vancouver, Columbia Icefield,
    Alaska</span>. We stayed at my uncle's for a while, before driving
    up for a tour of the glaciers. We also visited Seattle at some
    point, where I bawled my eyes out because I wasn't woken up to see
    salmon swimming up-river, despite the fact that there wasn't enough
    water anyway. Then we took a cruise up to Alaska, and had day tour
    to a glacial lake by sea plane. That was also the first time I wrote
    journals (although I stopped after the trip and didn't start again
    until 2002).
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1997 - Indonesia, Singapore</span>.
    My only memory of this is sitting in a van going through rural roads
    lined with banana trees.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">1999 - Germany, Austri</span>a. My
    most prominent memory of this trip was a stay at a countryside house
    for a night, where I slept on the top floor underneath a sky light.
    There was a waterfall near by, and we had breakfast at the owner's
    house.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">2000 - England</span>. My brother
    and I went to a summer camp near Cambridge first, before my parents
    picked us up and we visited the Lake District. Oddly enough, I
    remember the camp more than our family trip.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">2001 - Australia</span>. Another
    summer camp, near Brisbane, before we drove up to Cannes. Same thing
    with my memories.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">2002 - Christchurch, New
    Zealand</span>. The first time I flew in a plane by myself.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">2003 - San Francisco,
    Sacramento</span>. Really more of a college tour of that area. My
    brother and I stayed a a family friend's, then flew back by
    ourselves.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">2004 - U.S.</span>. All over the
    place, a 3 weeks college tour. Not sure I want to do that again...
    although, we did visit Grand Canyon at the end, which was fun.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">2006 - France, Spain</span>. First
    in Paris, then TGV down to Nice, and driving along the coast (and up
    into Avignon) before going down to Barcelona.
-   <span style="font-weight:bold;">2007 - England, Scotland</span>.
    Another university tour, for my brother this time. Started in London
    and drove up to Edinburgh. We then hiked the length of the
    Caledonian Canal in Scotland, which includes Loch Ness. No sea
    monsters though.

And this doesn't include travel for school trips, tournaments, or other
short trips.
