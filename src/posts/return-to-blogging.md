Title: Return to Blogging

Slug: return-to-blogging

I'm in the middle of statement of purpose hell right now, but I'm
pausing just to say this: I need to start this blog back up.

In the time between last spring break and now, I have posted very
rarely, from almost daily in February to only once in July. I know I was
on "hiatus", and "didn't have time" to post, so I just neglected this
thing.

But as I was looking at grad schools and the professors there, I
realized that those days of blogging daily was one of my more creative
and innovative days. I forced myself to write, to think, and this blog
became a record of that. I had to merge ideas to write longer posts on
computer science or religion. I had to find material for jokes, and do
research to see if my ideas have been attempted before.

Compared to that, now I barely write. My personal journal has fallen
into entries once or twice a week, and most of that is retelling of
events in my daily and personal life. While that is illuminating and
entertaining for my future self, I can literally feel my "mental
muscles" going into decline. If I being on break from this blog allows
me to make arguments against thinking, then it's time I'm back to
blogging. I need that pressure to keep myself productive.

So keep an eye out. This blog will soon be back to daily postings (in
the limit). I expect to start around 2008-12-15, but definitely before
2008-12-20.

Thank you all.
