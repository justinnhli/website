I’ve been tracking the presence of CTY online throughout the two
sessions, especially [through
Twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23cty), but also through
blogs. Last year [I found several
blogs](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2008/09/cty.html) which expressed
their amazement at what CTY does for them and for children. I did the
same this year, and found
[this](http://perpetualdissent.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/cty-post-rewrite-this-time-wiith-100-added-coherence/):

I’ve never done the real CTY (both summers I’ve worked with young
students), but I totally agree with what the author said. And I don’t
mean it just for the kids - I mean it for the staff as well.

On the other hand, because I’ve never done real CTY, I don’t shout "Die!
Die! Die! Die! Live! Live! Live! Live! Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex! More! More!
More! More!" during the American Pie chorus. So I was surprised to find
a [blog
post](http://freefloatinghostility.blogspot.com/2006/07/camp-of-our-own.html)
by someone who claims to have started the "Sex!" chant:

Whether you believe her or not is up to you. Do visit the post though,
and read through the comments - it’s more evidence of how CTY bonds
people.
