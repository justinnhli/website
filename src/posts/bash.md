No, not the [verb](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bash), nor the
[shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash), but the [quote
database](http://bash.org/). Not so great for the prude or conservative,
but hilarious for crude people... like me.

But I came across these two today, and they're neither... at least, not
when you read the whole thing.

Have fun wasting your life on bash.org!
