I finished David Buss' *[The Evolution of
Desire](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/046500802X/qid=1057091018/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5145576-9560159?v=glance&s=books)*
a while back, but I have been to lazy to post thoughts. It's a more
scientific look at human mating strategies and their
evolutionary/adaptive roots - a *The Game* backed by evidence, if you
will. I will only share two quotes here.

The first one is amusing:

> Feigning homosexuality so as not to incur the suspicion of the
> dominant man and then attempting to have sex with the woman when the
> dominant man is not around is a rare tactic among humans. Nonetheless,
> it is interesting that a few college men reported having observed this
> strategy.

Really? People pretend to be gay to get girls? And it works?
Interesting.

The second one is also amusing (emphasis mine):

> [The researchers] asked college women how upset they would feel if a
> man they did not know, whose occupational status varied from low to
> high, persisted in asking them out on a date despite repeated
> refusals, in a relatively modest form of harassment. On a 7-point
> scale, women would be most upset by advances for construction workers
> (4.04), garbage collectors (4.32), cleaning men (4.19), and gas
> station attendants (4.13), and least upset by persistent advances by
> premedical students (2.65), **graduate students** (2.80), or
> successful rock stars (2.71)... The same acts of harassment from men
> who different in status are not equally upsetting.

Score!
