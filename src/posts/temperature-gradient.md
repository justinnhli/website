Title: Temperature Gradient

I turned on the heater in my room for a good while today, while keeping
my door open. I also happen to have a length of PVC pipe for a project
stored in my room, just leaning against a cupboard.

I was pleasantly surprised that the PVC has a distinct temperature
difference at the top from the bottom. The material traps heat so well
and is such a poor conductor that the rising warm air heats the top, but
the bottom stays cool.

I love science.
