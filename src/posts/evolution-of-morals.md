There was a [feature in NYTimes
Magazine](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html)
written by the famous psychologist Steven Pinker, titled "The Moral
Instinct". It talks about how moral choices are difficult to understand
from psychological and philosophical points of view, and how morals are
not necessarily rational.

Some where in the article is this little passage:  

> In his classic 1971 article, Trivers, the biologist, showed how
> natural selection could push in the direction of true selflessness.
> The emergence of tit-for-tat reciprocity, which lets organisms trade
> favors without being cheated, is just a first step. A favor-giver not
> only has to avoid blatant cheaters (those who would accept a favor but
> not return it) but also prefer generous reciprocators (those who
> return the biggest favor they can afford) over stingy ones (those who
> return the smallest favor they can get away with). Since it’s good to
> be chosen as a recipient of favors, a competition arises to be the
> most generous partner around. More accurately, a competition arises to
> *appear* to be the most generous partner around, since the favor-giver
> can’t literally read minds or see into the future. A reputation for
> fairness and generosity becomes an asset.

The thing that fascinates me is how seemingly mathematical this
description is. The appearance of generosity, the actual generosity, the
percentage of lying, all seems to be describable through numbers, and
individuals are just a function with these numbers as input. These
individual agents would interact and learn, eventually leave offsprings
and die. A multi-agent simulation seems to go well with what Trivers
describes.

One problem that I have trying to understand this simulation
conceptually is what the default values for the offspring should be.
Intuitively, the offspring would be influenced by his parents (learning
by example in society). There might also be some influence from the
average of societal values, as the culture that the offspring grows up
in. Neither of these ideas, however, give a precise mathematical
definition of how to mix the two values.

I really want to try and write this simulation... when I'm not swamped
with work.

Could a simulation of this be done?
