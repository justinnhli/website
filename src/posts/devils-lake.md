No, it's not filled with fire. [Devil's
Lake](http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=43.413029,-89.697189&spn=0.266355,0.696259&z=11&om=1)
is a Wisconsin state park, about 4 hours away from Chicago. It's where I
spent Friday and Saturday night this past weekend, on a rock climbing
trip. It was fun, except for the last part when we got very lightly
rained on for 4 hours Sunday morning, before we left. If only it held
off till the afternoon, we would have gotten some more climbing in as
well as a dry sleeping bag. I would post pictures, but I don't have any.

Hope you all had a good weekend too.
