I was playing with [Twitter search](http://search.twitter.com/)
recently, and was curious who at Northwestern uses Twitter.

My first instinct, of course, was to just search for "Northwestern
University", but it was quickly apparent that people who attend
Northwestern don't actually write "Northwestern". Maybe this is due to
the assumed common context of the tweeter and the audience
("[grounding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounding_in_communication)");
the reader knows the tweeter is at Northwestern, and since conversations
try to maximize bandwidth, what is common knowledge is left unsaid.

The question then becomes: what terms *would* people at Northwestern,
and only people at Northwestern use? That is, what phrases are
semantically associated with Northwestern?

There were only two that I could think of:

-   "Dillo Day". It turns out that no other university in the world has
    a day in honor of armadillos (or whatever the reason NU actually has
    a Dillo Day). Of course, this only works when Dillo Day recently
    happened or is going to happen soon
-   Norbucks. This actually makes a lot of sense, since it's a
    portmanteau of Norris (University center) and Starbucks. By itself,
    either word is common, but this combination makes it unique to
    Northwestern.

Can you find any other phrases which are unique to Northwestern?
