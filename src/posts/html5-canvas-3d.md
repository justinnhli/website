Title: HTML5 Canvas 3D

The [WebGL standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) is developing
to allow 3D graphics on the web. Unfortunately, it is currently only
available in developmental branches of major browsers. In the mean time,
the HTML5 Canvas element provides support for 2D graphics... unless you
have a backend library to render 3D scenes. [Lookie what I
did](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/316654/blog/canvas.html). You'll need a
good browser... anything other than IE will do. Drag the display pane to
rotate; use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out.

In other news, I've discovered that I remember close to nothing about 3D
geometry.
