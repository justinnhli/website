Thanksgiving in a dorm room for the third year in a row. It's not that
bad, actually. My family has never celebrated Thanksgiving, so in a way
I don't know what I miss. I like Thanksgiving only because I get time to
do what I want.

Today it was reading cyberpunk fiction, so I Googled it, and found [this
little article](http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/commandline/index.html), "In
the Beginning... was the Command Line." I read it first without the
commentary, but they do add a needed update on the state of the art.
It's an interesting read, starting with command lines but drawing in a
lot of cultural stuff as well. I'm not sure I buy all of what the author
is saying, but it was food for thought.

Afterwards I found the author on Wikipedia, and found that he is now an
OS X fan. Hah.
