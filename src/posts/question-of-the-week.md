The answer to last week's question (Why is Katy Perry's "I Kissed a
Girl" controversial for both females and males to sing?) is two fold.
Females is of course the easy part. As for the male part:

1.  The line "hope my boyfriend don't mind it"
2.  The overall perpetuated idea that the singer doesn't like girls
    (such as "It's not what I'm used to" and "I kissed a girl just to
    try it").

As for this week's brain teaser:

In the movie xXx: State of the Union, Ice Cube drives a car onto the
railroad. The tires then rip, and the car turns into a train (of sorts).
Disregarding other issues for the moment (like whether the tires will
rip, and whether the width of the car precisely matches that of the
tracks), does a car in this situation need to be steered?
