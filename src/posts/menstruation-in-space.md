Last week's question: Do animals fear non-immediate, abstract things.

It turns out that this is a tricky question. First, what I called "fear"
is not actually fear, but anxiety, which is different. Fear has to have
a direct cause and somehow escapable, while anxiety can be indirect and
unescapable.

Reading the Wikipedia page for [fear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear)
says nothing about animals. The proper page to use is [Emotion in
Animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_in_animals)... which only
mentions fear once. It seems to be widely recognized that animals have
fear, but it is uncertain from what. It can be argued, though, that
animals can be clinically depressed, as the rather inhumane experiment
under the canines section shows.

So in that sense, if animals can be influenced by non-immediate events
(like the constant reminder of electric shocks... I'm really glad the
[Animal Welfare Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Welfare_Act)
was passed), then they do feel anxiety.

This week's question: We have had both male and female astronauts
staying in space for long periods of time. How does the low gravity
environment affects a women's menstruation?
