If you look closely at my last post, you'll see that the first paragraph
has a slightly different spacing than the paragraphs after the
blockquote text. The line spacing is wider for the first paragraph. The
same thing happens with unordered lists. If I take out the blockquote
though, everything would go to the wider line spacing as in the first
few lines. I can't think of any weird CSS that would make that happen.
