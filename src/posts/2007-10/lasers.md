Evanston is foggy tonight. Visibility is about 20 feet, max. It was a
slightly overcast day, but I didn't expect fog to roll in. Except it
did, after I left GSW.

And one cool thing about fog: each particle of water reflects light. So
what I did, I took out my laser pointer. Usually, laser pointers have
invisible beams, because there isn't enough energy or something. There
are ones you can get with a visible beam, on
[ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com) for example, and I think they use
four times more energy than normal pointers. Well, one thing this fog is
good at: reflecting light. Whenever my laser points into the fog, I can
see the entire beam. Now that is cool.
