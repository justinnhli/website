Title: Realizations from Optical Illusions

Slug: realizations-from-optical-illusions

That's a mouthful. We were doing some sensory (mostly optical) illusions
today in cognitive psych, and while there were a number which were new
to me, a bunch of them were pretty familiar ones. I thought back to my
childhood when I bought several optical illusion books, and came to a
realization:

I enjoy being tricked by my brain.

First, let me give you these two lesser known (but really good) optical
illusions:

[The Spinning Ballerina
Illusion](http://alvinology.wordpress.com/2007/07/25/the-spinning-silhouette-optical-illusion/)  
[The Face Mask Illusion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-00PPTHfn8)

The second one in particular shows how our brain is so used to seeing
faces, that we can't help but believe the face pops up, even when we
know it's the back of a mask. Of course, we all know that our senses
can't be trusted entirely. Not only our sight, but also our sense of
touch (poke yourself with two toothpicks about a quarter inch apart; you
could tell the difference with your fingers but not your back). Our
brain is trying to make sense of a lot of information at the same time,
and takes some short cuts in doing so, but in doing that some very
specific situations results in our brain telling us the wrong thing.

You can argue that there are other areas in life where our brain makes
mistakes. One area I thought of are jokes, especially puns. Puns work by
defying our common expectations, which may be cultural or habitual in
origin, but this doesn't show up in the grammatical structure of the
sentence itself. Here are a few puns, although I must warn you that I
take Edgar Allan Poe's quotation ("The goodness of the true pun is in
the direct ratio of its intolerability") to heart.

-   Two antennas met on a roof, fell in love and got married. The
    ceremony wasn't much, but the reception was excellent.
-   Deja Moo: The feeling that you've heard this bull before.
-   Here's a dead give-away: what's a will?

Of course, my love for both of these things doesn't really indicate that
I like being tricked by my brain, but that I like finding how the brain
works.

Some other area which this applies to came into my mind moments before,
but now it's gone. Isn't that fascinating?
