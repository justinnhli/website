In response to my previous post [Blogger Bug (or Bugger
Blog)](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2007/10/blogger-bug-or-bugger-blog.html):

The way to fix that is to put a line in the Blogger template CSS. Simply
add this line somewhere to the posts section:  

>     .post * { line-height: 1.6em; }

and that should fix all line spacing problems.
