The good thing was that I only had two days of classes this week. The
bad thing is that I had whole days with nothing to do. So, what I
actually did...

-   Watched Cars. It was interesting how Pixar used the wheels as the
    limbs. I'm not really sure how cars can move their wheels like that
    (granted, the wheels didn't turn into roller blades or guns or
    anything like that <span style="font-style:italic;">a la</span>
    Transformers).
-   Coded up half a genetic programming engine. I'm stuck on how to
    select a random subtree for crossover and mutation (by headless
    chicken crossover... I'm serious!). I found a site with a GP
    implementation in C, and I might steal some ideas there.
-   Wrote 4 lines of a sonnet.
-   Read [A Theory of
    Fun](http://ninghui48.blogspot.com/2007/11/fun-in-games.html).
-   Hunted down squirrels and Kurt Vonnegut.

It was fun.
