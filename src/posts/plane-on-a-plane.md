Last week's question was: why do men like women with long blond hair,
blue eyes, and large breasts?

I've actually known the answer for a while now, but for some reason it
came to my mind recently. No, it's not because I met a large breasted
women with long blond hair and blue eyes...

I first heard about this from (to my eternal shame) Psychology Today. In
their article on 2007-09-20, they mentioned that there are evolutionary
reasons behind these attractions. Specifically

-   Hair is a good indicator of health. Since hair grows slowly, long
    hair shows health over a long period. It's lustrousness shows
    nutrition in a healthy body. Finally, blonde hair tends to turn
    brunette over age, and so it's also an indicator of youth.
-   Blue eyes make the pupils easier to see, and hence easier to notice
    the dilation when the female is interested or aroused.
-   Large breasts... I had apparently skipped over this one when I first
    read it. There are two theories: One is that it is an indication of
    fertility (but not the ability to lactate). The other is that large
    breasts sag more with age, and is therefore an indicator of youth.

It would be interesting to see if these hold true over
people/populations who have no contact with at least the first two (the
last one being hard to control). For example, if photos of women with
long blonde hair only, with blue eyes only, with both, and with neither
were shown to, say, men from a small village in China, would they rank
their appearance in the same way?

For interested readers, the article I'm refering to is

This week's question is something I've wanted to solve for a while, but
never got around to it. Might as well make this blog force me.

When you look up at a passing plane, usually you'll miss where it is at
first glance. This is because the plane is high enough that there is
some delay between the image of the plane and the sound of the plane
reaching you. From this simple fact, it should be possible to calculate
how quickly the plane is flying, as well as how far the plane is from
you. The solution should be symbolic, and/but you can assume that:

-   The [speed of
    light](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=speed%20of%20light) is
    *c~light~* = 299 792 458 m / s
-   The [speed of
    sound](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=speed%20of%20sound) is
    *c~sound~* = 340.29 m / s
-   The plane is of length *l*. Assume you can recognize the model of
    the plane, and therefore know *l*.
-   In the direction of light and sound, the plane is equidistant, *d*,
    from you. That is, at any moment the point of origin of light (which
    you see), the point of origin of sound (which you hear), and where
    you are standing are on a plane and forms an isosceles triangle.
-   The plane flew in a straight line since it produced the sound until
    where you're looking at it now. The distance between those two
    points is *kl*, where *k* is any real number.
-   The path of light and sound are separated by an angle Î¸ (theta) as
    perceived at your location.

For bonus points: is it possible to calculate the same data if the plane
was not equidistant from you, but flying in an arbitrary straight line?
How/What other data is necessary?
