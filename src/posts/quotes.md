Sorry for the late post. I'm feeling kinda lazy, so I'm just going to
dump some quotes on you.

From Douglas Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach:

-   intelligence loves patterns and balks at randomness
-   Hardy on Ramanujan: With his memory, his patience, and his power of
    calculation, he combined a power of generalization, a feeling for
    form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that
    were often really startling, and made him, in his own field, without
    a rival in his day.
-   This is, it seems to me, a general principle: you get bored with
    something not when you have exhausted its repertoire of behavior,
    but when you have mapped out the limits of the space that contains
    its behavior.

From the TED Talk of Peter Diamandis, of the X-Prize Foundation:

-   The day before something is truly a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea.
-   [The X-Prizes need to be at] intersection of audacity and
    achievability.

From the TED Talk of Daniel Suarez, author of Daemon:

-   All juvenile mammals indulge in play; its our way of probing new
    realities and of learning our place in them.Â 

In other news, in econ so far I've gotten a 74% on the first midterm and
54% on the second midterm. This totals 74 \* .15 + 54 \* .3 = 27% out of
45% possible.

FML.

I should have gone with my instinct and stayed out of econ. I'm not sure
what it is, but econ and me just don't match up very well.

A.k.a. I suck at econ.
