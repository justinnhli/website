Title: Confession

I've got a confession to make:

I like romance comedies.

That sounds really girly, and weird and everything, but I do. It is
however a special kind of romance comedy. Ones filled with emotionally
significant awkward silences.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind</span>

Probably the most famous of the three movies. Neither Clementine and
Joel are very social people, and they just can't seem to get along with
anyone else. My inner shy self always hoped that it was their
awkwardness which had brought them together, that there was something in
the shyness which made the other reach out and break through their mask.
There is perhaps nothing humorous in itself in the movie, but just the
way Joel and Clementine talk about the situation, they way they
interact, creates the silences which make us uncomfortable.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Catch and Release  
<span style="font-weight:bold;">  
</span></span>Wikipedia said over 75% of the audience were female over
25. God knows why it attracted a young male below 20 like me. In my
journal I had wrote that I liked the way it showed how things don't turn
out the way you want it to, and that despite your deepest suspicions,
sometimes things are just not that way because of some good deed someone
did. Perhaps there is some situational humor in this film, with the way
Maureen had had just barged in with her kid. I liked the fact that there
is no situation at all, and that it was all just a misunderstanding
based on the good will of someone else.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Imagine Me and You</span>

I heard about this film somewhere before, but forgot about it until
tonight when I was bored and was browsing for something to watch. The
homosexual content aside (as it was written as a heterosexual romance
anyway, according to IMDB), the humor in this movie comes from the
dialog. In retrospect perhaps this movie is a little less awkward than
the others, but there were still a number of delicate moments.

One other thing I want to point out, I guess as an after thought. In
Imagine You and Me, Hect says to Rachel,  

> "Yes it is. I want you to be happy. More than anything else I wanted
> to be the cause of happiness in you. But if I'm not, then I can't
> stand in the way, you see? Because what you're feeling now, Rachel, is
> the unstoppable force. Which means that I've got to move."

That particular paradox/dilemma has been on my mind lately, for some
reason. In another form, it can be formulated as follows. You love
someone, so you would give your life for them. But they love you, so
they would rather you live and they die. You can either follow their
wish (you live they die) or your own (you die they live), but the funny
thing (and the paradox) is that you are both doing what you think the
other person wants.
