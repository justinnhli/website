A lot of things happened during CTY... but first I want to say that I am
blown away by the place. The "experience here is just so powerful that
we as teachers can't help but feel excited about this whole thing." That
was something that I wrote in my personal journal. And, apparently, I'm
not the only person who feels this way:

I wish, for more than one reason, that I was back there.
