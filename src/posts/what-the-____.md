Title: What The ____?

I don't get it: why do people bother to blank out swearing in songs? The
song which brought this thought on was Linkin Park's [Bleed It
Out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnuuYcqhzCE), which has two blanked
parts, I think. I mean, it's not like you don't know it's there, since
there's this conspicuous silence from the singer's track at that point.
The fact that it is blanked seems to suggest that the word is only
offensive if you hear it, but as long as you don't hear it (but <span
style="font-style:italic;">know</span> it's there), it's fine.

Seems very irrational to me. The better way of going that is to dub over
it, like some movies do. But of course then the song probably wouldn't
make much sense.
