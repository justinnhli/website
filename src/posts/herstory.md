I read a book recently (or maybe it was the internet; I don't remember)
where the author talked about how history has been male dominated and
asked the question, "what happened to herstory?" Well, if you want to
play that game...

I used a short [regex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
to find all the words in my computer's dictionary file which started
with "his", "man", and "male". I chose a few to systematically replace
with "her", "woman", and "female", with slight hand-tuned adjustments
for spelling. Here are some particularly funny ones (with commentary).

NOTE: Before you yell at me to say that not all feminists do things as
pointless as wordplay, I know. I'm using the word "feminist" (and
related terms) below to refer to those who do play these games.

-   *femalefactor* - female criminals; also, the critical element behind
    every successful man
-   *femalevolent* -Â  things like the silent treatment; also, witches
-   *herpanic* - what Spanish women would do if they found out about
    this change
-   *herred* - past tense of the sound female snakes make
-   *womanager* - your female boss
-   *womanatee* - another name for baby tees
-   *womandrake* - a shapely plant
-   *womaneuver* - the special way females handle vehicles
-   *womangled* - what every women's hair is when they wake up
-   *womanhole* - **\*ahem\***
-   *womania* - what Freud and folk psychology called "hysteria"
    (hersteria?)
-   *womanifold* - laundry; not to be confused with "womanifolds"
-   *womanipulate* - actually, this is the etymology of the word
    "manipulate"
-   *womanservant* - subject of a lot of male fantasy
-   *womanslaughter* - it seems like the unmodified version fits the
    feminist movement better

We can, of course, go further. See if you can identify the original word
for these:

-   *abdowomen* - the medical name for a pregnant belly
-   *accompaniwoment* - another word for escort
-   *antidisestablishwomentarianism* - the longest word in the English
    language
-   *Archeredes* - a virtually-unknown female ancient Greek
    mathematician
-   *ewomancipation* - the process of women obtaining political rights
    and equality under the law
-   *hashersh* - why feminism feels good
-   *homomorphersm* - another word for lesbianism
-   *husbgyny* - the domestication of women
-   *hywoman* - a membrane around the penis which breaks on first sexual
    intercourse
-   *multidiwomensional* - the idea that women cannot be rated on a
    single scale
-   *portwomanteau* - a famous species of wine grape
-   *rowomantics* - the behaviors of the female crew team
-   *serapher* - another word for angel
-   *whersical* - this list
-   *womenstruate* - actually, I have no clue what this means

I'll all for feminism, but really: there are more important things to
talk about than sewomantics. Also, study etymology.

PS. Also see the [ad fenimam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_feminam)
logical fallacy.
