Title: Gmail Spam

I just realized that Gmail, if it thinks something is spam, removes the
anchor hrefs. In this particular case, the href was around a link
claiming to go to paypal.com. With the anchor tag removed, however, I
was wondering how the spammer made money at all, since they give out a
cut and paste link.

Anyway, good job Google.
