Last week's question: How can you estimate the speed of a passing plane?
Certain assumptions are allowed. In the first case, let the distances
sound and light traveled be the same. In the diagram and equations
below, the variables are

-   *xl* - the distance traveled by the plane since it produced the
    sound you're hearing. *l* is the length of the plane, which you can
    look up by the model. *x* is how many plane lengths there are
    between the source of sound and the source of light.
-   *theta* - the angle between the paths of light and sound.
-   *d* - the distance traveled by light and sound. *d\_light* =
    *d\_sound*
-   *theta\_s, theta\_l* - the angle opposite the paths of sound and of
    light, respectively.
-   *v\_?* - the velocity of various entities. The speed of sound and
    light are given.

</div>

To get *v\_plane*, first we find *d* through the law of sines:

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;">

</div>

Then we equate the travel times of light, sound, and the plane. Assume
the plane has moved a negligible amount between the reflection of light
to your sighting of the plane. This gives:

</div>

That was pretty easy, wasn't it? This formula seems roughly correct; if
the sound and sight of the plane forms a 30 degree angle, the planeis
traveling at 176 m/s. [Online
sources](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/JobyJosekutty.shtml) say a
B747 actually travelsat around 240 m/s, which would be about 41 degrees.

Now for the bonus part: what if the distance traveled by light and sound
were not equal? Then we have the situation below:

I don't actually have a neat equation for this one, but I managed to set
up four (hopefully) independent equations, which will allow us to solve
this system. The four equations are below.

The simple ones first. By the sum of angles in a triangle:

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;">

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">

By the same relation, and the trigonometric tangent relationship:

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">

</div>

By the law of sines:

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;">

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">

Finally, this mess is created by using [Heron's
formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula) and the
trigonometric sine relationship:

</div>

That gives us four equations in the four variables *d\_light, d\_sound,
theta\_l,* and *theta\_s*. As I said, these *should* be independent; if
someone solves this (or fails), please let me know.

After these four are solved for, we use the same time equivalence
equation:

</div>

And we're done.

Note that in both cases, if you are also given the angle the plane and
the horizon *phi*, you can also calculate the height of the plane:

[tagged](http://fayezor.blogspot.com/2009/01/tagged.html) me for a photo
thing, and after questioning her definitions, I have this:

This was taken while I was at
[CTY](http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/2008/07/hello-from-stanford.html).
We were walking back to Stanford from dinner, and passed by the Facebook
headquarters. From left to right, we have Sam, Lizzy, Hina, Erin, and
me; Erica's behind the camera. We're all TAs for different courses. You
can see more of this set on
[Picasa](http://picasaweb.google.com/justinnhli/CTY), and the tagged
version on

To compensate for the tough question, this week's will be merely fact
finding, both related to ice rinks:

-   Are outdoor ice rinks actually made from pure water?
-   Is Zamboni a brand, or the name of the actual machine?
