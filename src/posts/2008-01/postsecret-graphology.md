The postcards on PostSecret, seeing that they contain secrets, are
supposed to be anonymous. The idea behind that is the secret itself
should be what you're focusing on.

I think it will be fun to do handwriting analysis on the postcards.

From this past Sunday's post, the

with "my Husband and I moved to A smaller house so the kids will
\_\_Stop\_\_ Visiting as \_MUCH\_!" scares me. Not only are the capitals
out of place, but considering it's a mom who has kids (and is possibly
near/at retirement), her writing is <span

I can't stop thinking about Delores Umbridge and her pink office...
