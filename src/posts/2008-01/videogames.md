Slug: videogames

I've spotted a curious difference between people in Hong Kong and people
in Chicago: a lot less people in Chicago have hand held video game
consoles.

That may be just because I'm in a university environment, and people
don't have time for games (\*snicker\*). Since a lot of people have
Xboxes or PlayStations in their rooms, however, it's not that they don't
like games, but somehow consoles like the PSP or Nintendo DS is just not
as popular.

In Hong Kong, I would see people playing games on one of those
everywhere, while traveling or even just walking down the street. From
what I can see of people on the El though, no one has one of these
things. I really doubt I've even seen a single handheld game (except
maybe really old Game Boys.

I wonder if it's a poverty thing, a stress thing, or simply a cultural
trend.
