Obviously I'm back in Chicago. So, this week, mostly classes:

-   Theory of Knowledge. I've already written a
    [post](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2008/01/computer-science-in-epistemology.html)
    about this class. Philosophy, if it's abstract enough (as
    epistemology clearly is), has a way of making simple things
    complicated. While that's not always desirable, for something as
    (shall we say) impractical as philosophy it helps with broadening
    your mind to other people's thinking.
-   Intelligent Information Systems. We haven't done anything yet. Lots
    of work and lots of fun.
-   Human Computer Interaction. The class is about exactly that, but
    it's turning out to be more work than I though. I wrote a good short
    paper on giving users choice for different interfaces. Could you
    guess I run Linux?
-   Design. Still working with dolphins, and as we try to actually build
    something our world is torn apart by what we don't know.
-   Locomotion. Still working on that, too. The goal for this quarter is
    to evolve a single layer perceptron controller.
-   GSW. Um. Still teaching.
-   Outing Club. I need trips. Lots of trips. So I can get away from
    this crap.
