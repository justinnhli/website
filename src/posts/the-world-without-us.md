Last week's question: How are the arches at Arches formed?

You can tell I'm running out of ideas when the questions are so straight
forward. The arches are actually formed the same way as any other rock
formation - through wind and water erosion. It's just that the rocks on
top have the correct hardness and weight to withstand the erosion while
the center crumbles away.

Boring, right?

This week's question is more interested. Literature has featured
anthropomorphic animals for a long time. What spieces, and at what point
of anthropomorphing, can animals take over (ie. extinguish, possibly
drive to extinction) the human race?

But it's really the title text I like: "When I say we should do
something sometime, I'm secretly hoping you'll say 'Why not now?'"
