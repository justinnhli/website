I won't lie, today has been really busy for me. I only had an hour long
class, but had six hours of meetings for various groups and projects.

-   At 11:00 was my locomotion research meeting, where we hashed out the
    basics of a genetic algorithm exercise
-   At 13:00 was my stats project meeting, where we started sorting the
    large amounts of data we had.
-   At 15:00 was my only class of the day, stats.
-   At 17:00 was my natural language meeting, where we divvied up the
    coding we have ahead of us
-   At 18:00 was my normal GSW meeting, the last of the quarter.
-   At 21:00 was my design meeting, where we solidified our designs.

And finally, at 01:00 the next day, I'm ready to go to bed.
