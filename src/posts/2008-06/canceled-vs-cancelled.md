Title: Canceled vs. Cancelled

Slug: canceled-vs-cancelled

The first 9 years of my education was in a British setting, and so I
spelled a lot of words the British way. When I switched to an American
school in 2002, I took a lot of that spelling with me. Some words I
adapted rather quickly, but others I have been reluctant to change. One
such example of the latter is "favo[u]rite", because the British version
has all five vowels (maaah).

An cool phenomenon I recently discovered is that my journal shows when I
adopted certain words. The word in question is "cancel[l]ed"; a quick
search of my journal gives the following:

\$ ./tools -Sd cancelled  
2003-04-29  
2003-08-26  
2003-10-15  
2003-12-01  
2004-01-07

\$ ./tools -Sd canceled

2008-04-08  
2008-04-29  
2008-05-31  
2008-06-07

A quick glance shows that all the way through 2006 I used the British
version, and the in 2007 I abruptedly changed to the American version.
The only disrepancy this theory leaves is the single uses of the
American version in 2003 and 2005. I guessed, correctly, to be quotes I
put in from other people.
