Hi! I have written in a long while, so I thought I'd talk about what I've been up to.

* First, I am clearly done with this school year. I am however still in the dorms, as I am helping out with convocation and get to stay an extra week.

* Next week I'll be headed to Stanford in California, to work as a robotics TA for the next month and a half

* I will be keeping a (lightly) encrypted blog for that purpose. The previous post is to test whether I can dynamically change blog content, which I can.

* We played four square and painted the rock, the final result of which is on North by Northwestern's [Rock On](http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2008/06/10967/northwestern-university-outing-clubjune-3/).

* That was also when I fell off my bike and got a lovely gash on my chin. I had to get stitches for it to heal, but it was fun to have anesthetics applied. It was also fun to not shave for a week so I won't break the sutures.

* I went rock climbing in Red River Gorge this past weekend, to celebrate a friend's graduation. Here are some [pictures](http://picasaweb.google.com/justinnhli/RockClimbingAtRedRiverGorge) I stole.

* I was bored these past few days, and made a owl button:

    Isn't the small own cute? For people interested, the font is a great small size font called [Silkscreen](http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/).

* I also put it in data: URI format (as the button is too), and used it as the favicon for my [calendar](http://justinnhli.googlepages.com/calendar.html). The button also appears on my [Google page](http://justinnhli.googlepages.com/index).

* What else... I watched Lion King. Twice. Once when Norris showed it, once with my project team. The best part of the movie by consensus: [Timon and Pumbaa do the Hula](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctxdAup1uzo&hl=en). You can be a big pig too! Oi!

Yup Yup Yup.
