A recent article in Northwestern's newspaper:

[Ivan the
Great](http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2008/05/08/TheWeekly/Ivan-The.Great-3367464.shtml)

The comments are largely negative, which surprises me a little. But
perhaps it is Jen Wieczner's slightly morose portrayal of Ivan that made
me like the article so much.

And, to be honest, I kind of envy Ivan.
