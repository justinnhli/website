Slug: microblogging

Today's the first time I've heard of the term, from the news that Google
acquired micro-blogging site Jaiku (a play on Haiku, by the way). I sort
of like the idea, but don't intend on trying it. After all, most of my
posts are fairly lengthy, like my last one, and I can't talk about
integrating logical and stochastic artificial intelligence in 200
characters or less.

I like micro-blogging because of its spontaneousness. Instead, what I'll
try to do is write down random thoughts in my Moleskine, and convert
them into sentences, posts, essays later on.

That's what Moleskines are for.
