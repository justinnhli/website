I sang this song with the choir back in middle school. We got either
second or third place in the Hong Kong wide competition with this.

Although my middle school years were mostly terrible, this song has
always stuck with me. It floats into my thoughts every once in a while.

Can You Hear Me?  
(By Bob Chilcott)

I look around me as I grow  
I'd like to tell you all I know  
I see life with all its energy  
The city streets, the rush time  
This is my world, it's where I like to be  
So much to see, so much to find  
I sometimes sit and wait a while  
See the sun, it makes me smile  
Can you see it  
Can you see it too

I feel life with all its energy  
The joy of waking every day  
This is my world, it's where I like to be  
So much to do, so much to say  
I sometimes sit and feel the sun  
Its warmth is there for everyone  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it too

My world is a silent one  
But it's enough for me  
I hear you through your hands  
The movement sets me free  
But it could be a special thing  
To hear your voice  
To hear your sing  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me too
