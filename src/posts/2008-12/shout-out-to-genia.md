Title: Shout Out to Genia

Slug: shout-out-to-genia

I finished my grad school applications yesterday, but I want to thank
Genia (the owner of the dinosaurium, link to your right) for her
enormous amount of time spent reading and giving feedback on my
statements. I am pretty sure without her my essays would be a mess, and
I'd end up homeless because I don't know what to do with my life.

Thank you.
