I've decided I will post on the xkcd schedule - every Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday of whatever time zone I happen to be in. That will give me
enough time to think and write, while being small enough a burden to
actually have a life. Not that I have one right now... LOL!!!!1!! jk jk!

For today, a short brain teaser: Why is Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl"
controversial for both females and males to sing it?

On a different note, I found
[someone](http://ali-wildgoose.livejournal.com/364204.html) who shares
[my view of homosexuality and
polygamy](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2008/05/marriage-and-society.html).
