This is the first time I've used Google Calendar and traveled between
time zones. When I loaded it up, it asked me if I want to change to Hong
Kong Time. I clicked yes, thinking it would just change the alerts and
such.

Nope. It actually remembers what your events are in *UTC time*, and
displays them in Hong Kong Time. I only noticed when Mythbusters was
suddenly at 10;00 on Thursdays...

Once again in so many days, good job Google.
