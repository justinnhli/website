Title: Blag Subtitle Change

Changed the subtitle from "random thoughts, occasional lengthy updates,
even mini treatises" to "the sand and rocks in my bucket of life." I
wanted to put the liquid in there as well, but water makes it sound
weird. I've heard a version of the story where they poured beer or
whiskey in, adding that no matter how full your schedule is there's
always time for some alcohol.

But I think that makes me seem like an alcoholic.
