Here's an interesting thought I had at lunch the other day.

Most people don't eat certain things because it's bad for your health.
The Wikipedia article for
[Judaism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism#Dietary_laws:_Kashrut)
states,  

> Major prohibitions exist on eating pork, which is considered an
> unclean animal...
> </p>

which conforms to our expectations.

However, there's also the case of
[Hinduism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism#Ahimsa_and_vegetarianism),
for which Wikipedia has,  

> Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef. The
> largely pastoral Vedic people and subsequent generations relied
> heavily on the cow for protein-rich milk and dairy products, tilling
> of fields and as a provider of fuel and fertilizer. Thus, it was
> identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure. Hindu society honors
> the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving. Cow-slaughter is legally
> banned in almost all states of India.
> </p>

Interesting how the final result (of abstaining from a food) is the
same, but the rationale is the complete opposite.

(For those wondering, I knew about the eating habits before. I just find
quoting Wikipedia so much easier than trying to explain it myself.)
