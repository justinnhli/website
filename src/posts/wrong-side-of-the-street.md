Title: Wrong Side of the Street

I have an observation I would like all of you to verify: is it just me,
or do people tend to walk on the opposite side of the road they drive
on? So for example, in the States people drive on the right, when
walking people will tend to walk on the left side of the sidewalk. The
reverse is true for Hong Kong.

It's probably more an availability heuristic (kinda like a flashbulb
memory) than anything, but does anyone else feel the same way?
