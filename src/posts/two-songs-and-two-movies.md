I recently discovered two things about two movies I like.

The songs [Fleeting Smile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INtAZkhHy5g)
by [Roger Eno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Eno) and [Everybody's
Gotta Learn Sometime](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIVh8Mu1a4Q)
performed by [Beck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck) (originally by
[The Korgis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Korgis)) reminds me of the
ending of [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind)
and [The Jacket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jacket) respectively,
and both songs make me smile involuntarily.
