In my design class we were introduced to the free online tool
[Doodle](http://www.doodle.ch/), a website where you can easily set up
polls. It's main selling point was for setting up meetings, but I
actually disagree with them. The main problem is they don't show a way
of including lots of different time slots. Well, they do, but the page
can get really wide and even more ugly.

Instead, I like to use it like normal polls. If there aren't too many
options, like just the seven days of the week without time constraints,
it works very well. Or to decide a movie to watch, or something like
that.

Maybe you can use it to help with communication too.
