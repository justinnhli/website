I was working on my Speech to Text engine, and I needed a cutoff for the
word size. I arbitrarily chose 30, which turned out to be the length of
'
*[pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism")*',
which appears in the OED.

On the other hand, the Wikipedia entry for [Longest word in
English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English) has the
following section at the end:  

> According to an old riddle, *smiles* may be considered the longest
> word in English, as there is a
> [mile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile") between the two
> *s'*s. A retort asserts that *beleaguered* is longer still, since it
> contains a
> [league](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_%28unit%29 "League (unit)").
> The riddle and both jocular answers date from the 19th century when
> standards for humor were considerably lower.

I didn't agree about the standards of humor being high now (considering
I still find these funny!), but the last observation apparently
references [Wayside Gleanings for Leisure
Moments](http://books.google.com/books?id=kokfAAAAMAAJ), a book
published in 1888. There was a second note for that sentence, which
says:  

> Even "longer" words exist (e.g., *gigaparsecs*, with a
> [gigaparsec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#Megaparsecs_and_gigaparsecs "Parsec")
> before the final *s*), according to the logic implicit in the jokes.

Hahahaha.
