Title: Speed Dating Video

Northwestern recently started its own [Youtube
channel](http://youtube.com/NorthwesternU), and perhaps because of that
NU has been producing a number of videos. One of the ones I like more is
[24@NU](http://www.24atnu.com/), which shows different groups on campus
doing different things at all hours of the day. For a lot of the videos
they need students to participate, so people have probably been hearing
about getting involved for a while.

Nothing beats [Steve
Carr](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/about/orgchart/Steve_Carr.php),
the associate dean for McCormick, telling us to go speed dating though.
That makes me laugh.
