Sometimes I think I don't write spontaneously enough, but this might change that.

WALL-E is Disney/Pixar's next film. You can [watch the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e16U8UsT4I)...

... find where the [idea of WALL-E](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAWIIlXNGwY) came from...

... and then [watch this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNAs94d_Ybw).

:D

In case you're curious, Courtney originally posted the video on this [blog post](http://betteronme.blogspot.com/2007/10/i-watch-walle.html).
