I came across this cool little table a few days ago:

I don't know whether it would actually help with privacy or
concentration, but it would definitely make for a very stylish office.
Although, my first thought on seeing the screens is that it could easily
be used as a theater as well. I mean, if the screens change anyway, I'm
guess you can put anything you want on them. With the screens spread out
into a hemisphere, you would have your own IMAX Dome theater. Which
would be absolutely awesome.

Wouldn't be quite so awesome if your boss caught you with that. I wonder
if you can get the image on the outside to be different from the image
on the inside?
