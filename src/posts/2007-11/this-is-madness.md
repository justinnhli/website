Title: This Is MADness

We were talking about mutual assured destruction (MAD) the other day,
and the thought just occurred to me. Can MAD be used to argue for
nuclear proliferation?

I mean, the whole theory rests of the fear of retaliation from the other
country, and that no matter what the offending country does, it cannot
completely destroy its enemy's ability to strike back. For the defending
country, this means it needs to ensure its weapons will not be easily
destroyed. And what easier way to do this than to make multiple nuclear
warheads, and hide them in different places around the country? The
larger the nuclear arsenal, the larger the threat of retaliation, the
more MAD applies.

As for actual proliferation, countries without nuclear weapons will feel
insecure against countries with nuclear power, and therefore will want
to have nuclear weapons.

Of course, that's the equivalent of having a nuclear arms war, but MAD
doesn't say anything about that. In the words of one of my design books,
the safety in MAD is only circumstantial to the situation, but not
inherent. It is in some sense a dynamic equilibrium; only when both
countries have nuclear warheads will MAD work.

Which, to be honest, makes MAD look a little, well, mad.
