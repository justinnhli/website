Title: A Guide to Stalking by Example

In my last post I mentioned that I [found a journal entry in a
pastebin](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2007/12/pastebins.html). My
curiosity was peaked, and so I took a little time trying to track down
who posted it, and perhaps a little more on what actually is going on.
When I thought of writing down my little adventure in this blog, it also
reminded me of an [article I read a few weeks ago on
microcelebrities](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-12/st_thompson),
where the author found a forum thread discussing the merits of him
finding a nanny for his child. As I'm typing this I'm also reminded of
several articles on how [googling yourself is getting more
popular](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvIKnTCFibsuq70pTBwoh7YPNfaQD8TIP4SG1)
and [might be a good
idea](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071216-googling-oneself-not-as-vain-as-you-think-say-researchers.html),
since it displays what other people can find out about you on the web.

In other words, how easily you can be stalked online.

I know that searching for my real name (one of ["Ning Hui
Li"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22ning%20hui%20li%22),
["Justin Li"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22justin%20li%22),
or ["Justin Ning Hui
Li"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22justin%20ning%20hui%20li%22))
doesn't get too much stuff, but searching for my online alias
([ninghui48](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ninghui48)) gets
almost everything I've ever done online. Further more, a few of my
profiles (in particular, my profile on Facebook) have very little
security while providing accurate and sometimes up to date information.
I know therefore that I'm a highly stalkable target.

I'm about to make someone else a microcelebrity.

First, the pastebin journal entry. On careful reading, you'll see that
even though the poster didn't provide a name to the pastebin, the author
of the post actually included his real name, "Ed", near the end of the
entry. When he quoted verbatim his note to Shannon, he included the
valediction and signature. So now we know he's called Ed, short for
Edward, as shown when he quoted what Shannon said over the phone, again
verbatim.

I don't mind long full quotes; in fact, I do that a lot in my own
journal.

My first attempt at finding the LJ was a simple search for the entry. I
googled the first line, then the crucial "Shannon was in love with me."
Nothing. I paused for a moment. Ed is a common name... but his AIM user
name, "oorza", isn't. Googling that gives links to last.fm, digg and
Beryl, but no LJ. It could very well be the same person, of course, but
it wouldn't give any information about him and Shannon. So I changed
tacks, and assumed that "oorza" is the username he used for LJ as well.

Bingo! It's a friends only journal, with a post telling visitors so. The
important thing to note in the post is that people should friend him to
get access, or find him through IM and "get [him] to copy paste this
shit to a pastebin." Which is exactly what I stumbled upon. Taking into
account that pastebins are technically oriented, and that the previous
results for "oorza" are also technical (following Beryl there are also
links to Compiz and Gentoo), the mention of pastebins in this LJ lets us
be reasonably sure that this belongs to Ed.

Although the journal is friends only, there are other things to learn.
Ed has posted several times before, but all of them lead back to the
same post, meaning that post was probably modified to update that line
about his latest post. More enlightening is his user info page. Seven
friends, one of them himself. The account type also caught my eye - Ed
had a Plus Account, meaning he's paying for his account. Checking his
friend's page shows that of the seven shows that \_\_\_ writes the
most - at least, he writes the most of everyone who's posts are not
friends only. His account is also paid.

\*\* PARAGRAPH DELETED BY REQUEST OF SUBJECT \*\*

Long story short, I ended up on Facebook which convinced me
(incorrectly, it turns out) that I found the author of the post.

\*\* END EDIT

That's about where I left off. I've found his friends on Facebook, which
adds evidence that they're the owners of the profiles we've been looking
at. Ed has no friend named \_\_\_, but seeing she's 45 (as per the
conversation), she's less likely to be on Facebook. I'm sure there's
more to be found if I dig deeper, but I found enough already.

So, what have we learned?

-   BE OBSERVANT. This is the most important. Even seemingly trivial
    details may be useful.
-   Google and Facebook are your friends.
-   Usernames are often used for multiple sites, leading to multiple
    search results for the username.
-   Usernames sometimes contain the users' real names in whole or in
    part.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the pastebin post was to someone else we
haven't encountered so far. They're not on LJ, or Ed wouldn't need to
post it to pastebin in the first place. \*shrugs\*

Had fun?
