Title: Google Integration

I like Google, I really do. That I'm writing this on Blogger and not on
LiveJournal is a statement of that. I also use multiple Google services
everyday, from email to RSS feeds to search to their web hosting. Google
doesn't have quite the same monopoly that Microsoft had during the 90's,
and it doesn't give off [that feeling of
evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil) either.

One problem I have with using so many of Google's services is that it's
not very integrated. Sure, attachments in in email could be opened with
Google Docs, and mentioning dates would prompt a GCal quick event, but
those are just specific instances of connect two other. Otherwise, all
my documents, emails, webpages, and videos on Google are in a different
place, with a different limit on their size.

What I really want to to have control over all my space on Google. For
example, if I don't really need that much space for my videos, I could
convert that to use for hosting space, or for documents. This allows for
much more flexible usage of Google's space.

I know that integrating all the storage space is probably a tough
engineering challenge. Hopefully, when Google [comes out with its
GDrive](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/11/gdrive-to-launch-soon.html),
it will become a reality.
