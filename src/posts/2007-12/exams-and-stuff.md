Got two presentations done today. Just my stats exam left, then I'm
done.

There's a meteor shower going on right now, about to approach it's
brightest moment, but I'm too lazy to go outside. Missing it is just a
sacrifice I have to make.

I'm missing someone else, too, but that's for me to know and you to find
out.
