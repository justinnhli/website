Title: Pastebins

Slug: pastebins

I came across this concept of pastebins the night before flying out,
while reading the arch linux forums. I was surprised that I have never
gotten to [this part of the arch linux
website](http://pastebin.archlinux.org/) before, and also that I haven't
even heard of pastebins until now.

It seems like a really useful idea (and it is by the number of people
using it). I myself don't remember trying to share too many pieces of
code through IM, although I'm sure I've done it before. There's a [free
version of a pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) (the original, in fact)
which anyone can use. You can also append a subdomain in front of the
URL to make things more private.

By checking the recently updated posts on that site, I noticed that some
people use it for entire essays. While I also write journal entries in a
one-entry-per-line format, I think pastebins are much more suitable for
text when the lines are short, e.g. code, configuration files, to do
lists.

And in fact, I think I just found a pastebin which someone uses as a
journal... Hehe. Aren't these things fun?
