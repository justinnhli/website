I'm two decades old :D. A quarter of my way to 80...

-   The presentation for my design class went smoothly
-   Got back to Hong Kong (obviously)
-   Got my grades for fall quarter. They were exactly as I had predicted
    them.
-   Reinstalled everything on my computer (Windows, Ubuntu 7.10, Arch)
-   Birthday!

Yep.
