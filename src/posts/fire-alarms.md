I think it's normal for some idiot college student to not know how to
use a microwave, set popcorn in there for 60 minutes, and cause the fire
alarm to go off. I think it's normal for that to happen at 3 in the
morning, since that's when students are most active. They do it once,
they know how much it annoys other people, they learn what they did
wrong, they don't do it again.

That's one alarm.

This morning our fire alarm went off. Three times. Within 3 hours.

Either that's a really dumb (and really persistent student, or the
system's messed up.

I really don't know which one to go with.
