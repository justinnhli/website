Last week's question: are patients in mental institutions allowed to
vote?

This is actually a rather touchy question, and its answer has changed
over the years as our understanding of the human mind has grown. It used
to be that there was really vague language describing who could and
could not vote. As far as I can tell, this decision is given to the
state. The constitution says nothing about the right to vote of people
who are insane, but only that people cannot be barred from voting by
reason of their gender or their age (as long as they are above 18).

One example of vague wording is in the New Jersey State Constitution.
Before 2007-11-06, Article II Section I Paragraph 6 of the constitution
[read](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Constitution_of_1947#SECTION_I):  

> No idiot or insane person shall enjoy the right of suffrage.
> </p>

However, an amendment passed to change it to the current:  

> No person who has been adjudicated by a court of competent
> jurisdiction to lack the capacity to understand the act of voting
> shall enjoy the right of suffrage.
> </p>

There is a difference in the wording of the two, in that someone who is
insane may still have the capacity to understand the act of voting. I
have not done any searches, but I suspect there are similar clauses in
the constitutions of other states.

For those interested, here's a case where [the state tried to bar people
from
voting](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/us/19vote.html?_r=3&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all).

This week's question: What atmospheric variables cause the formation of
rain, snow, sleet, hail?
