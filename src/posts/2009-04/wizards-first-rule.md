I got this in my RSS feed (from [Arch Latest
News](http://www.archlinux.org/news/440/)) on Tuesday night (around
23:00), and I was really annoyed for the next hour after that. Arch
Linux dropping i686 support? What am I going to do with my laptop? I
don't want to reinstall everything on a completely different distro,
especially since that practically promises to slow down my computer and
make it less customizable. I forwarded this
[Genia](http://petdinosaur.wordpress.com/) (who has been planning to
switch over to Arch after trying out Ubuntu for a while), telling her to
reconsidering the switch.

It was only until Wednesday night around 22:30 did I realize it was Arch
Linux's April Fool's joke. I have never fallen for something as big as
this (although I was Rickrolled twice by
[Ryan](http://ryangoesboom.blogspot.com/) - I just click on links by
instinct, and if it's not what I want I close them. Thanks [mouse
gestures](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6366)). I
recognized Google's joke right away - [Google
CADIE](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/cadie-awakens.html) is so
far ahead in the AI curve that it can't real. Also around the
Northwestern campus there were posters about [Jon Stewart coming to
campus](http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2009/04/02/Campus/Jon-Stewart.Flyers.A.Hoax-3693775.shtml),
which turned out to be a hoax. I did not see the posters myself, but was
told this by a friend. My first question was on the organization which
is bringing him to campus, but since my friend didn't know, we switched
topics to comparing Stewart and Colbert instead.

So Arch dropping i686 support is the only hoax I really fell for. Why?

The only hoax I really had enough knowledge to dispell is Google's,
because of my background in computer science. For Jon Stewart coming to
speak, I had no immediate interest. I used to watch The Daily Show, but
have stopped since the middle of last quarter. My lack of preference
allowed my rationality to kick in, and ask who was bringing him to
campus. For Arch though, the idea of them dropping support for i686 is
not out of the ballpark - they've dropped support for popular things
before (for example, the [official Sun JRE and JDF
packages](http://www.archlinux.org/news/418/)). The post even had links
to forum discussions, and knowing that Arch is a fairly international
distro, that the discussion was not in English did not surprise me.
Since this was plausible, and after reading it I was afraid it was true
(and didn't bother visiting the Arch forums, because I was sure there
would be a lot of complaining - again, April Fool's completely out of my
mine), I took the joke hook, line, and sinker.

The funny thing was, for most of the day I was pretty aware that it's
April Fool's, and took a lot of things with a grain of salt. And still
Arch took my completely by surprise.

I have to say, good job Arch Team. Keep up the good work.
