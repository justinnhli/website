Title: Global Warming and Religion

Two highly unrelated subjects, but today I came across a newspaper
article about the two.

[USA Today: Might Our Religion Be Killing
Us?](http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2008/04/might-our-relig.html)

I've never thought of it that way before, the affects of a large family
on global warming and resources. I think there are better ways to save
the earth's environment than chastising people with large families
though, like starting moving off fossil fuel and directly using the
sun's energy, designing everyday items and activities to enforce greener
living. If you let someone pick between a car and a bike, of course
they'll pick the car. What you need is to make the alternative
attractive enough... although, I must say the mileage on the bike looks
pretty darn impressive.

But then, of course, I [don't really
care](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2008/01/survival-of-fittest.html)
about this issue. We'll (speaking for all live here) survive.
