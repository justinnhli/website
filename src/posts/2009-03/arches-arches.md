Last week's question: what are the fluid dynamics of drafting?

Drafting is the practice of staying behind another moving object to
reduce the energy needed to move. This is possible because when air
moves past an object, there is a small area behind said object where the
air cannot reform as rapidly, creating an area of low pressure. This low
pressure is filled by pulling nearby particles, including those of the
following object, towards it, hence saving energy on the following
object's part.

Despite this somewhat technical explanation, I can't see to find fluid
flow diagrams of drafting. Maybe someone would be so kind as to provide
one?

This week's question: How are the stone arches in Arches National Park
and elsewhere formed?
