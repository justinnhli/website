I will respond to both comments and give a few more thoughts on my
unemotionality.

Yvonne: I don't think religion is completely irrational. As I mentioned
(and have yet to expound on), I think religion can be a rational choice.
What *is* irrational is the belief in God. What, then, is religion
without that belief? Good question. Buddhism, even though it doesn't
have a God in the normal sense, still says something about an external,
imperceptible reality - that we will reincarnate over and over again
until we reach nirvana. As I learned earlier this quarter, for something
to be classified as religion it must have some supernatural element -
which by definition cannot be demonstrated in science.

A religion without the supernatural is, I think, what we call
philosophy. If the main affect of religion is the passing on a moral
code, it would be ethics. The study of ethics itself can be rational,
and many philosophers have tried to find the "best" morals for humans.
One way this is done, which I personally belief in, is through the
realization that other people have feelings too. For me this entails a
version of the Golden Rule. If one understands that they are also human
and are just as flawed, makes just as many mistakes, and be just as
hurt, one would treat them with respect. This foundation of personal
morals is observable; it is hard to deny that other people are humans
without giving up a lot of other common believes (that our senses cannot
be trusted - this goes into epistemology). It is rational to have this
moral system as long as the senses are to be trusted to a certain
degree. If, however, the foundation of those morals are based on a
unprovably existing supernatural being, then the set of morals rests on
an irrational base.

I have to consent that this could be a debate on how much (or which) of
our senses should be trusted. One could say that we have a sense for
Godliness. I would argue here that we have instruments which confirm the
feedback from our normal five senses, while none exists for the
existence of God.

The purpose of this little detour is to show that, what some people
consider as a major part of religion can also be built without resorting
to supernatural phenomenon.

There is another aspect of religion which is crucial, and that is the
social aspect. Durkheim was the one who pointed out that magic is not a
religion - there is no "collective effervescence", because magic is an
individual activity. There is no society of magicians (in the medieval
sense of magic, not magic tricks). Shamans operate alone, and villagers
come to the shaman to be healed. For this reason, it is called shamanic
magic, and not shamanic religion.

And this, I think, is the main rational reason for joining a religion:
it provides a sense of community. For immigrants, which we've been
reading about in class, religion provides a lot of support for people
new to a country. Not only is it a more relaxing place to meet new
people, but it often also gives people comfort. Ethnic churches also
provide a connection to their home country, and a sense of fellowship
among similarly situated immigrants. To the extent that one wants a
sense of community, then joining a religion is a rational choice.

To sum up my response: theology is irrational, but religion - with its
extra social and psychological affects - might not be.

Faye: My response to Yvonne's comment applies a lot to yours too,
because it argues that religion is not pure irrationality. My thought on
Dawkins: religion does cause a lot of problems, but only the theological
side. The Crusades were started because two groups believe in two
different Gods (well, not really... but you know what I mean). I think
it's important to note that the existence of said Gods, never mind what
the Gods want, is unprovable. To cut to the chase, it's the irrational
portion of religion that is causing wars and violence.

If you read my [post of
logic](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2009/02/religion-and-logic.html),
the above statement can be cast as "if people believe in theology, then
there will be wars". I want to be clear that I'm not denying the
antecedent. I am not saying that if there's no theology, then there
won't be wars. I think there will be less, if only because there have
already been wars brought on by theology, but there are also wars fought
around other differences. But having less wars would be a good thing.

Would a world without religion be a better place? I can't really say.
There are questions in the philosophy of science we cannot answer, and
probably will never be able to. My dad brought up this point and I had
dismissed it before, but now I'm not so sure. Certainly, the social
aspects of religion can be replaced by secular groups - groups that
discuss science or current events, or groups that play sports together.
Will that have the same psychological affect as the "certainty" that
there is a purpose in life? Maybe. I do think if people were less devote
there would be more progress in science, medicine, and other fields,
which might have more immediate, practical effects on the world. Gene
therapy and stem cell research are both blocked by what I think are
irrational reasons (see my [abortion
post](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2009/02/abortion.html)), and if it
does lead to a cure for AIDS, that will save more people than religion
can.

In conclusion: I think there are pros and cons to a world without
religion, and I'm not sure it's possible to say whether it will be
better.

I want to address one specific part of Faye's comment further. She wrote
that Dawkins

To be honest, I can't say I entirely disagree with Dawkins.Â  I can see
where Faye's argument comes from: without religion, these cultures would
not have existed, and we would be losing the diversity of the world. On
the other hand though, the fact that religion helped build up the
culture says nothing about the culture not adapting new things.

The thing is, I see very little value in tradition. The ancient
civilizations of the world have social structures very different from
what currently exists in the modern world. There is value in studying
those cultures historically, to understand what happened in that time
period, but it would be a mistake to say we should continue those
traditions because they are traditions. Absolute monarchies, slavery,
theocracies, etc. have been eradicated in most countries, and I think we
can all agree it's for the better. The fact that they were important in
the history of modern nations says nothing about their current value.

To me, this idea extends beyond political systems to cultures and
behaviors. I don't see value in a lot of things. Birthdays, for example.
I understand the usefulness of marking the passage of time, and how the
current system is related to the sowing and harvesting of crops. But on
a cosmic scale, a second is not tied to the earth's orbit around Sol,
but [vibrations of a cesium
atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#International_second).
Earth-days and earth-years can be built on top of that - which of
course, means light years are also completely bogus units of
measurement, as is the [astronomical
unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit). A human birthday,
then, is some arbitrary demarcation of time. There is nothing inherently
celebratory about periods of 31,556,926 seconds after our birth, or
death, or the publishing of [a
book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species).

Back to religion. So what if religion contributed to the development of
a culture? The parts of a religion which explains natural phenomenon
(for example, the [kidnapping of
Persephone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone#The_Abduction_Myth)
causing winter) is being gradually supplanted by science. Keeping to the
tradition of religion here has no benefits, both in descriptive ability
and in technological progress.

Despite this, however, there *is* value in religion, for its societal,
communal, and psychological effects. As Faye pointed out, it is also of
historical importance. Therefore, I simultaneously disgree with Dawkins'
total abolishment of religion and the embrace of religious
irrationality. Rather, religion should exist as a community of support
for people who need them, but it should stay away from the realms of
science.
