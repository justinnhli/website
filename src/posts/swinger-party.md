Last week's question: What is the legal status of the verdicts shown on
court tv programs?

Apparently, the legality and degree of legal binding for these shows are
done on a per show basis. [The People's
Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Court#Litigant_compensation)'s
verdict is supposed to be binding, as are the verdicts in [Judge
Judy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Judy#Structure). Judge Joe
Brown's verdicts, however, has no [real judicial
power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Joe_Brown). What makes this
partially interesting is that both the persecutor and the defendant are
paid some amount to be on the show, and whatever damages award at the
end are deducted/added to that payment as necessary. The only advantage
to doing this over going to actual small claims court (which has a
similar damage limit of \$5,000) is that you get more publicity, and you
don't have to get a lawyer. Still, I would never do something like that
even if the public might be on my side. I just can't take seriously
people who want to go on TV during a court case.

This week's question: I've visiting a local playground a lot lately,
suddenly being in the mood to play on the swings. But why do kids (and
adults) like to play on swings and slides?
