I was bored (read: I didn't want to work) and so I clicked on the little
"Next Blog" link. I found out some things about Blogspot/Blogger:

-   There's a lot of blogs just with ads. I had to turn off Java and
    Javascript to deal with them; they crash Firefox
-   There's a lot of blogs with porn, which really is the same as above
-   There's a lot of finance, economy, job, etc. related blogs.
-   There's a lot of blogs in foreign languages
-   There's very little actually blogging.

Which is sad. Would have been fun to blog stalk someone.
