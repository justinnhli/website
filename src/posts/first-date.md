I learned something cool in social psychology today. Psychologists Don
Dutton and Arthur Aron did a study, commonly called the "bridge study",
where they tried to see if people would misattribute adrenaline due to
fear/anxiety to attraction
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_theory_of_emotion#The_High_Bridge_Study)/[paper](http://www.fpce.uc.pt/niips/novoplano/ps1/documentos/dutton&aron1974.pdf)).
They found that people did tend to "report" more sexual imagery when
they took the participated in the experiement after crossing a narrow
suspension bridge, and they were more likely to accept a phone number
("to find out the results of the experiement") than if they just crossed
a solid concrete bridge.

I thought about this result, and came to this idea: doesn't this mean
that on first dates you should do something that's adrenaline inducing?
A thriller, a roller coaster ride, rock climbing... anything to get
those adrenaline flowing, so it can be misattributed to you.

That sounds like a fun psychology experiement...
