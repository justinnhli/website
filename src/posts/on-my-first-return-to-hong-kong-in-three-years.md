More seriously, some of the changes since the last time I was here
(which was December 2008):

-   A lot of ads have Android/iPhone app icons, even Facebook links. QR
    codes doesn't seem to be quite as popular yet, although there's some
    similar system that seems local to Hong Kong.
-   All the steps on stairs seem really short. I can't tell if I've
    grown taller in the past three years, but I've noticed that I'm
    definitely above average height when on the trains. YES.
-   When I first got to the States I kept doing price conversions back
    to HKD. Now I do it the other way around, except that I have no clue
    what the baseline should be. 39 HKD seems instinctively more than 5
    USD, but it's ultimately the same. Obviously, small numbers are
    inherently more likeable (since we see them more often). I wonder if
    there's literature on how the conversion rate influences spending...
-   I've lost a lost of my spatial memory of Hong Kong, even for places
    I would visit on a weekly basis. Then my parents' house has also
    been remodeled, so it's a little harder to get around.
-   Whenever I've stayed in the States for a while then come back, I get
    allergic to *something* in Hong Kong and would always have a runny
    nose and keep sneezing. This time I settled with a partially stuffed
    nose. I think being sick just before leaving somehow buffered
    whatever I was reacting to.
