I've been slowly reading material on multi-agent models of society,
which requires a simulation of certain human activities. Not all, but
some.

The thought struck me today that this modeling of humans is a little
controversial, depending on how I phrase it. One could say that I'm
reducing human behavior into a set of rules, which is true in the
literal sense. But in doing so I'll also be discovering and
understanding more about human psychology and social behavior, which
seems like a more academic goal.

Personally, as a transhumanist, I don't think behavior as rules is a bad
thing at all.
