Here's a fun one. Below is a list of my percentage certainty when I say
some phrases. Imagine each phrase being inserted into the following
sentence:  

> "I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ this is true"
> </p>

Possible phrases include:

-   am absolutely certain = 99%
-   am certain = 95%
-   know = 87%
-   am sure = 85%
-   am pretty sure = 80%
-   am positive = 75%
-   believe = 70%
-   think = 65%
-   feel like = 60%
-   am guessing = 60%
-   have no clue = 50%

Note that the percentages are <span
style="font-style:italic;">not</span> the probability of that thing
being true; it is how <span style="font-style:italic;">sure</span> I am
of it being true. Unfortunately, there are some things which just aren't
true even if I believe it with all my heart.
