From [Ars
Technica](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080211-us-publishers-sell-by-the-chapter-give-books-away-for-free.html):
"Random House is... experimenting instead with selling books the iTunes
way, in bite-sized chunks; no longer will you need to purchase that
*Complete Guide to Astrology* when all you really care about is
Scorpio."

That's not a bad idea. I could imagine buying chapters of books for
research purposes. It would also be really useful for textbooks,
especially in classes where I don't really need them. I could just buy
the questions required as homework. Textbook publishers won't do that
though.

Shame.
