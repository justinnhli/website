status: draft


thesis: Not only are many forms of writing required for both academic and industry careers, but the habits of mind developed from being an effective writer will also lead to cleaner and clearer code.

outline
    writing in academia
        research papers
        grant proposals
    writing in industry
        planning documents
        development justifications
        tutorials and instructions
    shared:
        emails that will be responded to
            especially in dealing with clients
        explanation of ideas
        code documentation
    habits of mind in writing (and relation to coding)
        consideration of audience (and code documentation)
        reflection at outlining stage (and pseudocode)
        organization of points and relations (and design patterns)
        precise word usage (and variable/function naming)
        editing (and refactoring); never completely polished
        writing (and coding) as self-understanding and proofs of concept
    caveats
        a single course cannot do all of this
        goal of such a course (writing in the discipline programs)
