Hm. It would seem that I haven't done much this week. Nothing on my
schedule stands out to me; only the purple patches of my class time. I
did visit Shedd (again) yesterday, for another round of testing. The
bubbles look nice, and the dolphins showed interest (as well as fright,
but that's expected). This was also the closest I've been to a dolphin;
I was standing in the back wall walkway area, and the dolphins came up
to play with our guide, as well as just to peek out and look at us. It
was kind of cool, thinking about on it. I had one thought though: it's
hard to tell whether dolphins are happy or unhappy, they just look so
frivolous.

I wish I was a dolphin.
