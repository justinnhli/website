I'll be in Tennessee/North Carolina Smoky Mountains National Park for a
week. So I won't be commenting.

On a different note, my interview with CTY went well. I screwed up on
one or two questions, but I really got the interviewer's interest with
my lesson plan. Hopefully I'll get the job \*crosses fingers\*

I'll also be kind of awkward if she finds this post. Oh well.
