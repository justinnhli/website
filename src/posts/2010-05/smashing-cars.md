Slug: smashing-cars

I'm kinda unhappy with the [latest MythBusters
episode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_%282010_season%29#Episode_143_.E2.80.93_Mythssion_Control),
the one about two cars smashing into each other at 50 mph is equivalent
to one car smashing into a wall at 50 mph.

The way they tested the myth on a small scale was by swinging two
pendulums into each other, with each pendulum containing a lump of clay
and an additional weight in the back. The second weight would squash the
clay, and from the deformation the impact of the smash can be
visualized. It's a pretty clever rig.

My problem, however, is not with the rig; it's with the interpretation
of the myth. There are two ways in which the two crashes can be
"equivalent": from the perspective of the car, which is what the
MythBusters tested, and from the perspective of something in the middle.
Since the original myth is about a compact car being squished between
two semis, it would seem that this myth should be about the latter
interpretation. And in that case, I believe the crashes *are*, in fact,
equivalent.

As an educational show, I think MythBusters should have at least covered
this other scenario, and shown how the "myth" is more of an
interpretation issue.
