Haven't written about myself for a while.

Classes are going fine. I'm not really putting much effort into them...
which is sad. I'm doing a lot of other things which don't compensate
though. I've worked on my GPA for the last two years, now it's time to
let it slowly slide down...

This past weekend I went to Devil's Lake, my third trip there (although
it feels like I've been there more than that). As always, rock climbing
was fun. The weather could have been better, warmer, sunnier, but we
still got a half day of sun, which I'm happy about.

Also, on that note, I'm now president of NUOC. Heheh... now I'm <span
style="font-style:italic;">obliged</span> to focus on that and not
schoolwork. I love my life.
