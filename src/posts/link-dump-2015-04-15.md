* How much [do directors need to know about acting](https://stories.californiasunday.com/2015-05-03/joan-scheckel)? It's strange to me that a class on directing is filled with acting exercises (although to be fair, they also practice other things like blocking). I can't imagine a class on school administration being focused on how to teach, so why is directing different?

* By chance, I first read about how [the internet is still making us lonely](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/01/future-of-loneliness-internet-isolation), then immediately afterwards how [climbing is becoming a mainstream sport](http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/selling-rock-climbing-in-the-social-media-era) (if only in the spectator sense). There's a connection here - maybe in the way we emphasize the proxies of online accounts and star athletes instead of going out and actually experiencing things ourselves?

* I don't always agree with Roger Schank's view on education, but he is right about [the need to let students learn what they want.](http://educationoutrage.blogspot.com/2015/03/zakaria-and-ivy-graduates-keep.html). Sort of. I still think people need to learn algebra, but *teachers need to put that in the context of what students want to do*. After all, if we claim that algebra is necessary for whatever they do, we damn well better be able to prove it.

* A surprisingly comprehensive [presentation on gender diversity issues in computer science](http://katieirenec.blogspot.com/2013/04/let-me-tell-you-what-i-know-about.html)... by an undergraduate.

* It turns out that being a professor involved with research is [a lot like being a manager](https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2015/01/19/becoming-a-manager/). I've been thinking about how I should be relating to the students that are helping me with research, and the [three prongs of support, coordinate, and direct](http://qz.com/365469/good-engineering-managers-dont-do-one-job-they-have-three/) really resonated with me.

* I don't quite understand the thesis that ["feminist porn" is not feminist](http://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/whose-porn-whose-femnism/). The article freely mixes the harms done to individual performers as desperate individuals with the harms done to society as a whole (via mimicking the unsafe sex practices/fake violence in pornography). The latter is an interesting point and something worth discussing, but I don't agree with the former. I particularly dislike the question of "is anyone really entitled to buy someone else's body for sex" - I mean, is anyone entitled to *prohibit* someone selling their body for sex? There seems to transition from consent to censorship between the two questions.

* Turns out [lots of powerful men wear the same outfit every day](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/02/fashion/mens-style/The-Men-Powerful-Enough-to-Wear-the-Same-Thing.html), as a way to reduce their daily cognitive load. I don't buy the "this raises awareness of how we judge women by their outfits" purpose - at least, if that was the goal, there would be a movement to get more people wearing the same outfit every day.

* This is old news for many, but David Foster Wallace's speech for Kenyon College's 2005 commencement suggests that the point of philosophy and education is so students [learn to recognize life's questions the way fish should learn to recognize water](http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words).

* Being more "rational"/logical doesn't make you happy. But if you want to be happy, being "rational"/logical does make you happier - [it's not about what you want to achieve, but how well and how quickly you achieve it](http://lesswrong.com/lw/m07/desire_is_the_direction_rationality_is_the/).

* Lego may officially release a [4000 piece model of the Titanic](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/04/lego-titanic-could-be-one-of-the-biggest-kits-ever/).

* I was mostly off Reddit on April's Fools, and I finally learned what [The Button](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8383165/reddit-button-explained) is.

* A new psychology study from Cornell found that most faculty [prefer 2:1 hiring women over men for STEM positions](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/women-preferred-21-over-men-stem-faculty-positions) (all things being equal). We're still in a bad place, but this means that the slope is now positive (at least in academia).
