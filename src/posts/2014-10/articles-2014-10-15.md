Title: Articles I've Read (2014-10-15)
Date: 2014-10-15

So, I'm thinking that since I read enough articles, I will do a links post much more frequently than every month. I'm considering every week, but every two weeks might be more realistic.

This is what you get if you [pay $23,000 for a plane ticket](https://medium.com/travel-adventure/what-its-like-to-fly-the-23-000-singapore-airlines-suites-class-17d9f3fee0d).

The New Yorker [comes *this* close](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/suicide-crime-loneliness) to saying that existential depression is justified

[Yosemite Valley makes climbers nostalgic](http://eveningsends.com/climbing/valley-uprising-nostalgic/) the same way that [traveling by train](http://spnzr.com/aboard-amtrak) does for normal people.

There's an art exhibit that shows [the artist's Grinder messages](http://hyperallergic.com/153310/public-display-of-gay-mens-photos-texts-incites-outcry/). It's surprising to me that the article focuses on the homosexuality aspect, because I think a similar outcry will occur even if a more heterosexual-dominated dating site (say, OkCupid) is used instead. Also, arguably the personal details we put on dating sites are *meant* to be consumed by other people. So what is the real problem here?

Technology culture is becoming big enough that general societal problems are cropping up. First in [Linux with systemd](https://plus.google.com/app/basic/stream/z13rdjryqyn1xlt3522sxpugoz3gujbhh04), then with the [changing demographic of "gamers"](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224400/Gamers_dont_have_to_be_your_audience_Gamers_are_over.php).

The paranoid (to me) [rules this family has for avoiding the police](http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2014/10/08/pages/7596/index.xml?page=1) demonstrates my privilege more than anything else I've read.

A [somewhat sobering reminder](http://nautil.us/issue/17/big-bangs/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math-rd) that, for a lot of people, the equation `F=ma` does *not* intuitively mean that if `m` gets bigger but `F` stays the same, then `a` must get smaller.

"The notion of the bucket list [...] privileges [a restless consumption](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/kicking-the-bucket-list), a hungry appetite for the new. I've *seen* Stonehenge. Next?"

I've never felt much of a "cultural/ancestral" link to my Chinese background, but Sleeping Dogs apparently [roused it for the author](http://kotaku.com/what-sleeping-dogs-gets-so-right-about-being-an-asian-a-1644011008).
