Title: Links for September 2014
Date: 2014-09-30

I'm starting a new thing where I post interesting articles that I've read every month.  This emulates what Scott Alexander [does on Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/28/even-more-links-for-september-2014/).  It will also be fun to reflect on the assortment of things that I've read; as [Elodin](http://kingkiller.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Elodin) from Kingkiller Chronicles would say, "Small facts lead to great knowing".  Also, my book-reading pace has [slowed](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6732010-justin-li?shelf=currently-reading&sort=position&order=a) considerably in the last couple months.

(Aside: A lot of links this month are from [previous Slate Star Codex link posts](http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/links-2/), since I was procrastinating by going through them.  I will be more original next month.)

Starting with Slate Star Codex itself, Scott Alexander talks a specific form of [*reductio ad absurdum*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum): [proving too much](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/13/proving-too-much/).  This is when you make an argument that does prove your point, but also proves some other absurd thing; I've made the case that, for example, some [definitions of objectification](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2013/06/defining-objectification.html) do this.

Speaking of tools for thinking, The Rationalist Conspiracy discusses how San Francisco [blames its problems on the tech community](http://rationalconspiracy.com/2014/01/28/san-franciscos-tech-problems/).  I don't know if there's a name for this fallacy, but I think of it as [failing to see what's not there](http://www.richardwiseman.com/LaughLab/second.html).

On the other hand, being *too* rational is often a bad thing, particularly when it comes to what people consider emotional things.  [A lesson to be learned for robots](http://www.techandfacts.com/robot-programmed-to-fall-in-love-with-a-girl-goes-too-far/).  And for [dating sites](http://mashable.com/2013/11/02/carrot-dating-business-model/).

In addition to my trouble with objectification, I also have trouble understanding the [boundaries of "cultural appropriation"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/03/06/what-would-salon-think-of-an-article-called-why-i-cant-stand-asian-musicians-who-play-beethoven/).

A. O. Scott argues that [our "forever young" desires is reflected in the media](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/magazine/the-death-of-adulthood-in-american-culture.html), and that something is lost because of it.  I agree; childhood, while fun and playful, is also [impulsive and lacks seriousness and introspection](https://twitter.com/justinnhli/status/453175424378355712).

This may be why [Hong](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/09/19/what_wrong_with_hong_kong_three_reasons) [Kong](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/hong-kong-pro-democracy-protests-surprising-police) [is](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/world/asia/clashes-in-hong-kong.html) [rioting](http://time.com/3444164/hong-kongs-protesters-are-fighting-for-their-economic-future/).  I understand the freedoms at stake, but I'm also not sure if barricading the subway is the right response.

I am slowly becoming the senior grad student in the lab.  [It happens to everyone](http://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2014/09/11/not-the-newbie-anymore-growing-into-mid-career-mentorship/), and like everyone else, it has sneaked up on me.

Life in academia may not be [as free as people think it is](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/09/17/the-week-end-freedom-test/).

In other news, we now have a [computational definition of "galactic supercluster"](http://www.vox.com/2014/9/4/6105631/map-galaxy-supercluster-laniakea-milky-way).  And it's breathtaking.

And finally, I though ground radar would have discovered all overgrown forest ruins by now.  [Apparently that's not the case](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lost-world-honduras-city-monkey-god-pyramid-466952).
