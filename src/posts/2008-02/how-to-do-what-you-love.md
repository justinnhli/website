Title: How To Do What You Love

I was thinking about one of those personal trivia quiz thingies, and one
of my thoughts was that while I'm a nerd, I try hard to be a renaissance
nerd. Googling that term gives some interesting results, but I ended up
spending time at [Paul
Graham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham)'s
[site](http://www.paulgraham.com/). I've visited the site before, and
have also read a few of his essays, but today I spent more time on it.

My attraction to his essays could be from his view the superiority of
nerds and intelligence, but I also like his humor.

His essay titled "[How To Do What You
Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html)", however, was not about
that. It's about, on a more abstract level, how to live a good life, the
idea that "work" is not necessarily different from "play". It's an idea
I've played around in my head for a long time, and have had discussions
about it with other people. Thus, I wanted to see if my idea of the
concept was the same as Graham's.

After reading, I didn't find to many points of disagreement. There was
however one idea I was taken with. In the essay, Graham points out that
one of the harder parts of the problem is figuring out what you love. He
writes,  

> The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it
> even if they weren't paid for itâ€”even if they had to work at another
> job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers would do their
> current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and
> take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?
> </p>

That set me wondering, what do I do in my spare time that I don't get
external/material rewards for?

Let's start with what I have been considering as my dream job, teaching
and doing research in computer science at a university. Whether this
passes the test or not depends on how you break down this job:

-   Do I code in my free time? Yes, although less frequently now than I
    used to. In high school I'm constantly typing on my TI-83+, writing
    small programs. That was really what started me into computer
    science (besides a semester course on visual basic, and having been
    "home-schooled" before in HTML). I still have my proudest creation,
    a Minesweeper game in TI-Basic. I still code in my free time, but
    they have been for the most part limited to a few projects.
    Actually, no, I take that back. I tend to focus on one project at a
    time, although I tend not to finish them. I played around with
    NUCollab and a Northwestern Lost and Found system, I helped with
    [NULink](http://nulink.northwestern.edu/), I started a game called
    Ant Wars. I still write short bash scripts every now and then, and
    I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my HTML/JavaScript
    calendar as well as my journal search bash script. So yes, I code in
    my free time.
-   Do I do research in my free time? This is a somewhat harder question
    to answer. If by research you mean what I signed up to do, that is,
    modeling human walking with the BME department, then I'm afraid I
    don't work on that too hard at all. I could argue though that I did
    in sign up for it of my own free will, so I'm allowing it to take up
    my free time. If research is merely classified as "learning stuff
    you don't already know", then yes, I "research" a lot, especially on
    Wikipedia. These are not always computer science related, but they
    tend to be.
-   Do I teach in my free time? Yes. GSW is a big (as in important, not
    time consuming) part of my life, and it is the only paid "job" I
    have currently. And I do enjoy it a lot, as I've told someone last
    quarter that GSW is "sort of my highlight of the week." I also help
    SHPE and NSBE freshmen prepare for midterms, so this is the clearest
    one of what I do in my spare time.

One thought about research - people arguably took up their jobs because
they liked something about it, as long as they wouldn't go bankrupt or
starve otherwise. I can see an argument being made about how people are
already "doing what they love" to a certain extent, but that is clearly
not what Graham or myself had in mind (I feel so self-absorbed to be
putting myself and Graham in one sentence...). I would say that both for
my work with WebComm before, and the research I'm doing now, that I
don't <span style="font-style:italic;">have</span> to work, but I did it
because I want to.

So I seem to be on the right route to doing what I love. But by pulling
out computer science professorhood (or is it professorship?), I actually
deceived all of you. There's something I've been doing a lot more in my
free time than teaching, researching and coding, possibly even combined.
It is in fact right in front of you: writing. I've kept a journal since
April of 2002, and started this blog September of last year as well. I
write an awful amount, and none of this gives me any reward except for
satisfaction. Writing is, in fact, my most productive endeavor. As Paul
Graham writes,  

> Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have
> a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist,
> are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As

I do not, however, intend to be a writer, editorial or otherwise. Coming
upon Graham's site is actually an inspiration, because he, like me
(again self-absorbed), writes [a
lot](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html). I don't think I would
mind if my life turned out to be like his.

By "don't think I would mind" I mean "Yes! Please! Please! I beg you!"
Eheh.
