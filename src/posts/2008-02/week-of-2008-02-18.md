Well, I'm in a pretty bad mood. I really want to hit or throw something.
This is mostly the f ault of me losing my keys yesterday. The best case,
now that I've checked the lobby of my dorm, is that it's in the car that
took me to the Shedd yesterday. The worst case is that I dropped them
when I took coins out of my pocket for parking, and they're lying in
downtown Chicago somewhere.

This really sucks.

As it were, I'm not the only person to lose something yesterday. Someone
in our group lost a phone somewhere on the trip. I guess it just wasn't
a good day for keeping property.

Other than that, my week

-   

Actually, I don't really care right now. I went down the Shedd on Friday
and Saturday, and went lugeing yesterday. Those are the highlights.

I'm still pissed about my lost keys.
