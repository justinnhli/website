I took this one from a friend. Usually I have little regard for this
type of personal trivia, but for some reason this one caught my
attention. I think the first question is especially rare: it borders on
one of the party games I've played before. "Party game" is not the right
term; it was a very intellectual activity, one only the closest friends
would enjoy. So here goes.

Ten Anonymous Things You Want To Say To Ten Different People

1.  I wish you would open your mind about certain things. Being right is
    not about insistence, but about the ability to explain why.
2.  I don't think having the second best is better than not having at
    all. Hopefully you'll find what you really want one day.
3.  I am glad for all the adventures we've had, although I have to say
    that having known you for quite a while I still don't completely
    understand you.
4.  I think (and fervently hope) that respect each other more than we
    admit. Someday we'll both live happily, I know it.
5.  Somehow we've gotten closer when we've been further apart.
6.  Your childish innocence and naivety makes me happy. I hope my
    craziness has brought you the same joy.
7.  I've always thought that something was holding us back from
    something wonderful. But now it's a little too late.
8.  You were an awesome partner to work with, and I know you will do
    well in the future, even though I don't know you well.
9.  You are a great friend to have stuck with me all this time. We'll
    have more time together yet.
10. You'll be fine... You'll be fine.

    research, but I'm still not entirely sure if it's right for me
6.  I alternate between piano solos and progressive metal
7.  I'm cool enough to write my own calendar and not use

    believing life is hopeful
