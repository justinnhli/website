I reinstalled Google Earth today, for fun, after not having played with it since high school. It was fun to explore different places, including where I might be going for spring break.

It was a picture from last year's spring break which brought me the greatest joy.

Here's a picture from the trip:

And here's what I can get from Google Earth:

That's pretty amazing. That's why we all love Google.
