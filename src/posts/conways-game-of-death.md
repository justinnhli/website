Today's [Spiked Math](http://spikedmath.com/) gives an interesting twist
to [Conway's Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), complete
with [zombies](http://spikedmath.com/299.html). I was curious what the
actual interactions were like, so I modified a
[NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) model to do the
simulation.

As in the comic, <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> means human,
<span style="color:red;">red</span> means dead, <span
style="color:orange;">orange</span> means zombie.

[Enjoy!](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/316654/game-of-death/death.html)
