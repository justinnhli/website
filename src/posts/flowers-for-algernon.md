I just read Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon. It's the first serious
fiction book I've read in a while. I empathize because sometimes I feel
lonely in the same way - my intelligence not as high as the protagonist,
of course. Keyes creates a sad yet loving and lovable character, and I
find parts of myself mirrored in him. I suppose that's what people find
all the time in other novels and movies.

I am solemn right now, as though the book talks not fiction, but
describes my future. I don't think I would have the strength to see
myself devolve, not after seeing what I am capable of. I would have
killed myself.

I just want to say I love you. Really, I do. I just don't know how to
show it.
