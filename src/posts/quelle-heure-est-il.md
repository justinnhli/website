Title: Quelle heure est-il?

I don't own a watch, and don't have a clock in my room. If I'm out and
about, I could either look at clocks (found in classrooms, banks, on top
of towers, etc.), look at other people's watches (which requires a
little skill in mental rotation), or look at something I have which has
a clock (laptop, camera, etc.).

Although I usually leave my laptop on when I sleep, I blank the screen
so it doesn't brighten the room at night. If I wake up but don't feel
like getting out of bed yet, I can't really tell from my laptop what
time it is.

Instead, I've sort of trained myself to get a rough idea of the time by
looking at what color the ceiling is, and how big a difference in
brightness there is between the window "shadow" and the rest of the
ceiling. If it's dark all round, it's probably before 6:00. 7:00 or so
is a little lighter, but the contrast is not that big, as the sun is not
up yet. The largest contrast is about 7:30 to 8:00, when there are
actual lines delineating the window "shadow". Past that, the room keeps
getting brighter, while the contrast disappears, until past 9:30 or so
when the room is comfortably well lit through the curtains.

An alarm clock would probably be less work, but this works too.
