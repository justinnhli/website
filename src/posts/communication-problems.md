I think one of the sillier problems people can have are communication
problems. Not the kind where you didn't get someone's email, but the
kind where you don't tell other people what you want, and then blame
them for your lack of happiness. This happens a lot in romance films,
perhaps because a lot of people in real life have that problem. I think
people just need to grow up and take responsibility.

And guess what? One of my teams is having that problem. Bugger.
