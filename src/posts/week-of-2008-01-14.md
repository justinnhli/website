Visited the Museum of Science and Industry today, in freezing weather.
There weren't as many interactive physicsy stuff as I thought there was,
and the shop was definitely sub-par compared to, say, the shop at the
Science Museum in London, which had solar powered hot air balloons for
sale.

Besides that, this week has basically been work, work, work. Sad.
