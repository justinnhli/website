I have in store for me this coming week, besides the usual classes and
teaching and meetings:

-   A hiking/camping trip to Indiana Dunes, IN
-   Readings, supposedly for reflection on how I understand language
-   Programming, making a computer understand propositional logic
-   Problem set 3 for stats
-   Problem set 4 for stats
-   Summary of a psychology experiment
-   Draft for our research so far in the submersible project (which you
    know nothing about)
-   Differential equations to be modified so the 5-link model can walk
    on a slope.

Go away and leave me alone.

Just kidding. You can distract me from my work as much as you like.

Well, not too much.
