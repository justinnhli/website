Title: Batch Writing

Slug: batch-writing

A while back I posted about how I [sit and write multiple posts at
once](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2007/10/blogging-habits.html). I
just realized that it's actually equivalent to me batch processing my
posts. It's somewhat more efficient, which is cool.

I still do that, by the way, but I don't publish them immediately.

Speaking of blogging, I've decided to take my first break from my
personal journal since I started it five and a half years ago. I don't
have the time and brain power to write that much right now. As a result,
I suppose posts on here might get a tad bit more personal. Just a tad. A
picotad.

:)

Hope you don't mind.
