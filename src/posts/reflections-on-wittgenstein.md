Slug: reflections-on-wittgenstein

I just finished [David Stern's
introduction](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/393801.Wittgenstein_s_Philosophical_Investigations)
to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, and my mind got blown in
a non-minor way. I want to share some of the thoughts that went through
my head while going through the book. I am not a philosopher, and I
didn't read the original text (English or German), so I can't say I am
representing Wittgenstein's views. But what I can do is to play both the
role of what I think I read, and how I respond to that those particular
ideas. This will be presented as a short dialog between a devil's
advocate (indented) and a god's advocate, where the former takes a
skeptical position. The devil's advocate should be taken as one would
Zeno in proposing [his
paradoxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes): he is
trying to show how something that "obviously" happens as an
impossibility. The god's advocate will then propose explanations as
solutions.

Common ground is necessary, but it is a mistake to assume that common
ground must be some form of communication. Any two strangers, in any
culture in any period of history, already have a common ground: their
shared evolutionary history.

Any two humans, when they communicate, already share 3.5 billion years
of ancestral cohabitation on earth. Our physiology and psychology have
been shaped by common forces, leading to similarities before even the
first grunt. Our brains interpret - and misinterpret - perception in the
same way; we process information through similar algorithms with similar
biases. When a teacher waves a fork, the learner is biologically
programmed to pay attention to the movement. In fact, this behavior is
so primitive that it is a shared trait between a large portion of
animals. We also associate and cluster stimuli that occur together,
sufficiently so to mistake the ring of a bell for the presence food -
and perhaps the audio signal "car" for a wheeled vehicle. Again, this is
common ground with many other animals.

Other traits are more recent in evolutionary history. A number of
vertebrates - cats, dogs, great apes, dolphins - are also social in
nature, and our brains are also adapted for such an environment. We are
biased to mimic other people's behavior, and project ourselves into
their position to understand them. At least a partial understanding of
facial expression is inborn, allowing infants to replicate certain
expressions. There are theories which hypothesize the hard-wiring of
stronger forms of communication structure, but it is clear regardless
that common ground for communication exists. The information processing
commonalities above, together with the correct assumption that the
teacher operates in the same way, allows the listener to infer the
meaning that the teacher intended.

It goes without saying that this shared evolutionary history does not
rely on further prior common ground. It can therefore safely serve as
the foundation for the building of communication and language.

Brains are probabilistic, but so is the world! It is a fallacy to assume
that communication needs to be precise exactly; it is sufficient for it
to be precise enough. Precision is a double-edged sword: too little
precision and there remains ambiguity, too much precision and the
communication cannot be generalized. Language is learned and used in the
real world, where nothing is clear cut. It is in fact a power of
communication to capture these ambiguities.

That language is ambiguous doesn't mean that language is unlearnable.
Language is not learned as a whole, but slowly, piecemeal, over a long
time. The first word doesn't need to be precise - and as pointed out, it
can't be. All it needs to be is a first approximation, and this
approximation can be refined over time. The fuzzy concepts between the
speaker and the listener do not need to match up exact, but just needs
to have sufficient overlap. As long as this overlap is precise enough
for the world, then communication is meaningful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first arguments from the devil's advocate is somewhat close to my
understanding of Wittgenstein. Given that most of the counter-arguments
are made decades after Wittgenstein's death, I don't know how much of it
was known to Wittgenstein. The idea that human physiology and psychology
has such unescapable influence on everything was a new thought to me. A
smaller version of the idea, that no one sees an object/event in the
same way, has been pushed on me before, but this is different. It
suggests that even concepts we find "objective" - for example, the maxim
of Ockham's razor - may be the result of our evolutionary history
(although [a Bayesian explanation
exists](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/01/12/occams-razor-bayes-theorem/)).
I have been occasionally interested in how cunning linguists propose we
establish communication with aliens. Most schemes begin by establishing
numbers, then showing mathematical concepts. But how does mathematics
arise from probabilistic biology?
