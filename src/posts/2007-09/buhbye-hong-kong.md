Well, this is the first time I've overslept for a flight for a very long
time. Or just slept for a flight at all. Usually I stay up the entire
night, and (attempt to) sleep on the plane. It helps with the jetlag,
making me tired enough to fall asleep when it's night at my destination.

This time, I fell asleep at close to 5 am. I was supposed to leave at
7:15 am. I suck.

Anyway, I really have to go. See you on the other side of the Pacific.
