Sorry I haven't updated in a while. I'm sort of slipping back into the
wait-till-something-big-happens-and-I'll-write-an-essay-about-it
mentality. It should be slightly easier now, with all the
new-school-year-frenzy dying down a bit.

I thought I would use this entry to describe my classes and other campus
activities a bit.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Natural Language Understanding</span>

Not as in "learn English," but as in why telling a computer to do
something is so god damn hard. An interesting class, which led to me
reading about puns and palindromic poems ([Doppelganger by James A.
Lindon](http://www.museworld.com/archives/001265.html)). My favorite
example showing a computer's problem is the following sentence, and it's
several interpretations. The problem we're trying to solve is, how do we
get a computer to understand the real meaning?

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Cognitive Psychology</span>

Should be an easy course, although I like the professor a lot. He puts
humor in a lot of experiments and results. I've taken some cognitive
science classes before, so there is a good portion which is overlapping.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Interdisciplinary Design Projects</span>

My most intense course. It's a two quarter long design course, with real
clients and real impacts. I have yet to know my project, so I'll say
more when I get my assignment (should I choose to accept).

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction to Statistics</span>

Another easy course. The professor starts off assuming we don't know how
to calculate averages. Er, duh.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Research</span>

Recent got a to help a professor do research in bipedal locomotion
a.k.a. walking. Again, haven't done much. I'll give updates.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">GSW</span>

Teaching, the highlight of the week! Haven't done much yet either
though.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Outing Club</span>

Same.

Sorry this is kind of lame. I'm a little tired of writing.
