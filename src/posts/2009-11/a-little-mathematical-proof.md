Did you know that if you take any non-negative integer, then subtract the sum of its digits, the answer will always be divisible by 9?

For example, today's date is 11/06. 1106-(1+1+6) = 1098, and 1098/9 = 122.

Curious why? Here's a [more general proof](/files/a-little-mathematical-proof/digits.pdf) [pdf], that the difference between a number and the sum of its digits (if written in base *b*) will always be divisible by (*b-1*).
