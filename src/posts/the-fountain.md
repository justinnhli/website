I didn't feel like doing work tonight, and so I randomly picked a film
to watch. I've heard of The Fountain a while back, and I think I even
read the plot summary on Wikipedia, but it never stuck with me. So,
since I know it's a sci-fi movie, and I don't know the plot, I picked
it.

It made a good decision. After watching and going back to Wikipedia to
find out how it was received, I was surprised that it was only received
moderately well. I myself liked it a lot, although the plot (except for
one part) was predictable. One of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes had
called it a piece of poem, and I think that describes the film more than
anything else. I can see how the director had aimed it at being
comparable to 2001: A Space Odyssey, and in a way I think it is.

I highly recommend this film.
