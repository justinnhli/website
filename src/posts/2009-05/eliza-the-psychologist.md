Last week's question: Why do children like playing on swings and slides?

You know, even after spending some time looking on Google, I couldn't
find a satisfactory answer to this question. If I may, however, I would
like to propose the following partial solutions:

-   Swings and slides both offer the kid motion, and it's faster motion
    than they at that age can acheive themselves. So it offers a novel
    sensation for the children.
-   Along similar veins, at least the slide offers a new tactile
    experience as well. I can't think of that much else where you can
    feel solid material sliding underneath your fingers.
-   Slides and swings are usually located in playgrounds, where lots of
    children gather. The opportunity to play with other children form
    the last part of the appeal.

Some adults (like me!) still go and play on slides and swings, and
personally I think it's for much the same reason. Of course, as
herion\_e [pointed
out](http://justinnhli.com/posts/2009/05/swinger-party.html#c4447424143984291679),
there's also the nostalgia for us, too.

Building on the last point above, this week's question is: why do humans
have social needs?
