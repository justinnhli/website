Title: Snow!

It snowed a lot in Chicago today. I learned a few things

-   Cycling on snow is actually not that bad...
-   ...as long as the snow doesn't do anything to your bike...
-   ...such as it melting and making your seat wet...
-   ...or melting and freezing again to form a, shall we say, "icing"
    for your seat...
-   ...or freezing on your brakes so there's no friction at all.

I rode my bike to the computer lab, and was forced to walk it back
because by the time I left, it had turned to hailing. The last two
bullet points actually happened to me.

On the other hand, it snowed! So I can't complain.
