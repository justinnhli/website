I'm slipping. Here's what has happened in my life since the last post:

- Saw Ratatouille. (Walked out of it. Did not buy it. Although, it was
better than that "Throw Mama from the Tambien" crap.)  
- I bought a bike! A Trek 750. Haven't gone on a trip yet though. Should
do so sometime this week.  
- Wrote a chat bot which insults people. Here's a transcript:

hello  
(SHUT UP AND STOP ACTING POLITE)  
no you shut up  
(SHUT IT YOURSELF)  
it was your faut  
(LIKE I WILL EVER IT WAS MY FAUT)  
Yes it was  
(IN YOUR REAR COW DERRIERE)  
dont insult me  
(YOU ARTLESS TOAD-SPOTTED HORN-BEAST!)  
you pinhead  
(NO YOURE PINHEAD)  
Mother lover  
(IN YOUR REAR COW DERRIERE)  
This is stupid  
(IN YOUR REAR COW DERRIERE)  
youre so dumb you have to repeat yourself  
(NO YOURE SO DUMB YOU HAVE TO REPEAT YOURSELF)  
I didnt repeat myself  
(THAT ALL YOU GOT LOSER)  
Im not a loser  
(TO CALL YOU STUPID WOULD BE AN INSULT TO STUPID PEOPLE)  
alright Im sorry  
(YOUD BETTER BE SORRY)  
I give up  
(GO HOME LOSER)

That's it for now!
