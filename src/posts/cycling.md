Cycling's tiring.

Last week (Saturday 2008-04-05): 37 miles, to Chicago just north of
Promontory Point and back.

This week (Sunday 2008-04-13): 33 miles, to Chicago Botanic Gardens.
North on Sheridan and Green Bay Trail, south on North Branch Trail with
an extra loop around Skokie Lagoons.

Next week (???): \~40 miles, probably down to Chicago again.

Fun.
