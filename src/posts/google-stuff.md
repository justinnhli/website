Title: Google Stuff

Google has been pretty busy this week:

-   Google Chrome Beta was released. I've played with it a bit, but
    without mouse gestures I just couldn't commit to it. Ars Technica
    has a
    [review](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080902-hands-on-with-chrome-googles-browser-shines-mostly.html),
    which is better than anything I can write. My one thought for the
    browser, which I haven't yet seen voiced, is the connection between
    Google and Microsoft, and Chrome and MSN Explorer.
-   Picasa got a face detector, and I tagged all the faces it could
    find. It was a nice distraction from whatever I was doing. The most
    amusing thing, however, is shown in the following picture:

I therefore conclude that Google's face recognition software is really
quite good :D
