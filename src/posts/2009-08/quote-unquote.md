Title: Quote Unquote

Slug: quote-unquote

There are a number of things which I don't like about English
grammatical rules. The one I want to address here is the nested
quotation, which is not only confusing but unwieldy. Consider the
following example:  

> Adam said, "I like apples."
> </p>

What if this was part of a narrated story?  

> Beth said, "Adam said, 'I like apples.'"
> </p>

And if I nest that again...  

> Carl said, "Beth said, 'Adam said, "I like apples."'"
> </p>

Obviously, anything this complicated should be rewritten in any case
(Carl said, "Beth said, 'Adam said that he likes apples.'"), but putting
that aside, it really bothers me that I cannot just copy and paste a
piece of text, wrap quotations around it, and be done with the change.
If you notice carefully, the rules of English require the outer-most
pair of quotation marks be double quotes ("), and each nesting from then
on alternate between double quotes and single quotes. For the
copy-and-paste usage case I just mentioned, this means all the quotation
marks needs to be switched, which is extremely annoying.

Despite this asinine rule, I can actually see the reason: the inability
to distinguish between nested quotes and sequential quotes. Compare:  

> Carl said "Beth said 'This note reads "This note can talk."' I like
> talking notes."
> </p>

with:  

> Carl said "Beth said "This note reads "This note can talk."" I like
> talking notes."
> </p>

The first sentence is Carl quoting Beth who is quoting a talking note.
The second can mean the same thing, but the ambiguous quotation can also
mean Carl quotes Beth, then adding his own comment, and someone else
replying. In proper quotation, this latter meaning should be:  

> Carl said, "Beth said, 'This note reads.' This note can talk?" "I like
> talking notes."
> </p>

It can be argued that the alternating quotation, therefore, makes the
meaning of nested quotations clearer (with some excuses as to other
improper punctuation, of course).

The main problem with the quotation marks is that the starting and
ending marks are the same. By nesting the quotation marks, inner quotes
will never be "accidentally" terminated by outer quotes. More modern
character encodings solve this problem with using different characters
for beginning and ending quotes. You can look at [the Wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Typing_quotation_marks_on_a_computer_keyboard)
to see how to type the different ones - although most word processors
will do that for you automatically anyway. With computers, the problem
is compounded by the starting and ending single quotes doubling (or as
it were, tripling) as the apostrophe as well. This is only really a
problem for contractions at the beginning of words though, such as
"'cause", which could be interpreted as a starting quote. I'm not sure
how word processors deal with this.

Personally, I prefer to stick with
[ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). Since I quote a large
amount of emails and chats in my journal, and the emails and chat
themselves very often quote other things, I can't be bothered to switch
the quotation marks back and forth. This sometimes does cause me a
little more comprehension time, but compared to the time I would have
wasted on changing punctuation, it's not a big deal.

How do you use quotation marks?
