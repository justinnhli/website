Slug: list-of-discarded-post-topics

I have a large backlog of topics I want to blog about. Most of them were
interesting at the time, but I have since lost enough interest to not
want to write about it. If anyone is particularly interested in
something, or want some clarification of what I would have written
about, let me know.

Below are the topics and the notes I've collected for them.
