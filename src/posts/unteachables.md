Title: Unteachables

A partial list of things that cannot be taught:

-   Effortlessness
-   Heroism
-   Subversiveness
-   Resoluteness
-   Commitment
-   Individuality
-   Sympathy
-   Spontaneity

This is not to say that you can't *induce* people to be some of these
things, it's just unclear how they can be *taught* them without already
knowing how. Some teachable things, but difficultly so, include:

-   Detachment
-   Critical Thinking
-   Inner Peace
-   CreativityÂ 
-   Responsibility

The only line I can draw is that the second list seem to be more about
ways of *thinking*, while the first list contains ways of *being* or
*feeling*. If anyone can draw a better line, or has ways of teaching
things on the first list, leave a comment below.
