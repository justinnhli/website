Busy week. Went climbing Monday, then class, GSW, and meeting. Had a
better Tuesday than the last, with my project closer to completion.
Another meeting at night. Spring break planning is going well, although
a potential kink just came up. Starting Thursday night I didn't sleep
till 3 (and on Sunday morning, 5) in the morning, working on a GUI regex
webpage. It works pretty well; I'm more than pleasantly surprised by how
good it looks. That's really it... two weeks more of work hell, and then
I'm free! Free! For a week. Bummer.
