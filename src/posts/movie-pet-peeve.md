Title: Movie Pet Peeve

Unlike a lot of my brethen (males, although probably less than most
people think), I do watch romance movies. I don't think they are as
stupid as some people make them out to be, but I have a pet peeve: I
don't like movies where communication (or lack there-of) causes the
tension. I think it's important people be in control of themselves at
all times, and not rashly act out of anger. Even more important,
however, is being honest with each other, and it's surprising how many
films are based on the premise of tension caused by a secret.

Let me give an example. Nicholas Sparks' A Walk to Remember was turned
into a film in 2002, starring Mandy Moore and Shane West. The Wikipedia
page mentions several differences between the book and the film (as well
as the fact that it got negative reviews). The most significant
difference in my mind, however, was not mentioned. In the film, Jamie
and Landon have a falling out after Jamie tells Landon about her
leukemia, Jamie leaving because she doesn't "need a reason to be angry
with God". This never happens in the book. Jamie tells Landon that she's
dying, and they stay together and face everyone in town. There was
sadness, definitely, but no anger. Both Landon and Jamie accept that as
reality, and work to make what short time they have better. Although
perhaps Jamie shouldn't have concealed her sickness, the book Landon's
response is the best I've seen: understand, be calm, and face it. It
agitates me when movies show people who overreact to revealed background
information. The person you know is no different, and unless they were
really good actors, you probably know who they really are anyway.

So, here's a list of movies which use miscommunication and dishonesty to
cause tension.

Bad movies:

-   A Walk to Remember - see above.
-   Mamma Mia! - Sophie should have told her fathers the truth (that she
    doesn't know which of them is the real one). The tension comes from
    all three thinking they're her father.
-   Hitch - The whole journalist/"date doctor" thing
-   Moulin Rouge - Satine lying to Christian to get her to leave, so she
    can conceal her sickness.
-   The Prince and Me - Discovering he's a prince doesn't change the
    kind of person he is.
-   How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days - See Hitch.

I did, however, liked:

-   Definitely, Maybe - April's behavior when Will told her he loved her
    is borderline, but I think more of the plot is driven by Will's
    awareness of his love.
-   Stranger Than Fiction - Also self realization. I think the plot
    *would* be better if Harold died though.

Also, I want to point out that in the case of The Lake House, the plot
itself was bad enough, but also there's a time paradox. Since Alex
planted a message for Kate and they stay for two years until Kate sees
them, they are living the same timeline. In that timeline, Alex is
supposed to have died in the traffic accident; however, the Alex we
follow survives. So who died? I have to say, I disliked that the movie
didn't make logical sense more than anything else.

On the other hand, here's something which I always thought was a great
question. If two people have the same goal, and the goals are not
mutually exclusive, why is it so hard for them to understand each other
and work together?
