* Why do we cry when we're happy and laugh when we hear bad news? A new study suggests [it's the body's way of moderating extreme emotions](http://news.yale.edu/2014/11/11/why-i-m-so-happy-i-could-cry-makes-sense) so we can get over it faster.

* I've been thinking about what a "CS0" course would be like - a course where students don't necessarily learn to program, but still learn computer science. One topic may be [how software development works](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2015/05/06/computing-education-that-everyone-needs-that-has-nothing-to-do-with-programming/), and what to do when you encounter (what you think is) a bug.

* Maybe it's time to [move beyond scientific papers](http://edge.org/response-detail/25514) as the default mode of publishing results.

* Why do we work for 30 years then retire for another 30, instead of [making lots of money working for 10 years, then "retiring" for 10 before working again](https://medium.com/@chrisloer/join-the-engineering-leisure-class-b3083c09a78e)

* Every programmer should learn Lisp, for many reasons, one of which is that [it takes the "code is data" paradigm literally](http://blog.rongarret.info/2015/05/why-lisp.html).

* We English-speaking folk mostly swear with sexual and fecal material (eg. fuck, shit, etc.). As do the French... except for the Quebecois, who [swear with religious symbolism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_profanity) (eg. [*hostie de calice de pourris de tabarnak*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U72QVCgh_Q), literally "the host of the chalice of shit of the tabernacle", but semantically "motherfucking piece of shit"). As for the Dutch... [they swear with *diseases*](http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2011/07/26/dutch-swears-with-diseases/) (eg. *Sterf aan kanker!*, that is, "die of cancer!").

* What role does a professor play in the world of MOOCs and free educational YouTube videos? One answer: [someone worthy of respect and (maybe) emulation](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/whats-the-point-of-a-professor.html).

* What role does the college campus play in the world of MOOCs and free educational YouTube videos? One answer: [a third place where students can follow their creativity](https://medium.com/@alexcusack/the-future-of-the-collegiate-campus-c1acf2d35a9e).

* A good description of [how sexism can be invisible](http://lifebeyondfife.com/death-by-a-million-cuts/). Key quote: "When I'm asked what I look for most in a job, I'll probably say hard, interesting problems with clever people using new technologies and best practice methods with a good salary. What I haven't said is probably the most important detail and one that in some sense goes without saying. I want a comfortable, safe environment."

* I *really* want to know what those bright spots are on Ceres. Here's [a cool gif](http://i.imgur.com/tsm3wN0.gif).

* What should a college do if swimming is a required core class and [a student is aquaphobic](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-hard-mit-class)?
