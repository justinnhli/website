I am an assistant professor at [Occidental College](http://www.oxy.edu/), formally belonging in the [Cognitive Science department](http://www.oxy.edu/cognitive-science/) but also teaching for [Computer Science](http://www.oxy.edu/computer-science/).
My research is broadly on the strategic search for knowledge during problem solving, in both people and artificial agents.
Problem solving often requires knowledge, but finding that knowledge is not simply asking a question of memory and receiving an answer.
Instead, the agent must decide what question to ask, whether that question will likely result in a useful answer (or any answer at all), how to formulate the question given the constraints of memory, and finally whether whether to continue or to terminal the search if the answer is unsatisfactory.
I draw inspiration from human meta-memory phenomenon and information seeking behavior, and ask how problem solving, decision making, and inference is integrated in searching for relevant knowledge.

I am specifically interested in:

* inference in semantic networks
* unsupervised extraction/transformation of knowledge
* memory mechanisms in cognitive architectures
* application of reinforcement learning to memory use
