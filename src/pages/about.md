I am currently a computer science PhD student at the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu/), working with [Professor John Laird](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/) on the [Soar cognitive architecture](http://soar.eecs.umich.edu/).
My research is broadly on the mechanisms and strategies for knowledge search &mdash; how artificial agents can find relevant knowledge at the right time for its decision making.
My thesis looks more specifically at knowledge search for goals, also known as goal re&ndash;activation or [prospective memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_memory), which is the ability for agents to remember to do things in the future despite continual forgetting.
