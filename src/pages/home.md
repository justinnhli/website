title: About
save_as: index.html

I am currently a computer science PhD student at the (University of Michigan)[http://www.umich.edu/], working with (Professor John Laird)[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/ on the (Soar cognitive architecture)[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/home].
My research is on (prospective memory)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_memory] &mdash; the ability to remember to do things in the future &mdash; and how artificial agents can do this in the face of forgetting.

In my spare time, (I read)[http://www.goodreads.com/justinnhli, (I write)[http://justinnhli.blogspot.com/, (I code)[http://github.com/justinnhli], I climb, I bike.
More of my online presence can be found on my (Google profile)[https://profiles.google.com/justinnhli].
